"Excuse me!" Gumption said loudly.
"We don't have to go with them.
We… don't… have… to… go… with… them!"
he repeated loudly as Maddy and the storkbot both started to speak.
"We just have to *arrive* with them."

Twelve hours later,
he, Maddy, and a little hexabot that Maddy had christened Click
lay next to each other
in the bottom of a wagon full of supplies
in the barn on the edge of town.
It had taken them an hour to unload enough boxes and crates
to make a space for themselves,
an hour filled with whispered admonishments to each other not to drop things
and to pay attention to Click,
it was trying to tell them to put that box *here* and not *there*.

Once they had made room for themselves,
their knapsacks,
and the little bot,
they wrestled a board into place to serve as a roof for their little cave
and re-packed everything on top of it.
After some more whispers of,
"No, not that one, *that* one,"
and,
"The other way around!"
the wagon's contents looked more or less as they had at the start.

There was just enough room for Maddy and then Gumption
to wriggle into their hiding place.
They lay on their backs and braced their feet against the board above them.
With a, "One, two, three,"
they shifted it over to close the gap.

"Well, that was fun,"
Gumption whispered.

Maddy elbowed him.
After a moment of silence,
she said,
"It's a lot easier in stories, isn't it?
Hiding and stowing away and all that—folk just do it.
Nobody ever says it's hard work."

"Yeah,
and nobody ever talks about the smell,"
Gumption agreed.

"The what?"
A moment later she said, "Eww!
Gumption Goat, you're disgusting!"

"Sorry," he whispered cheerfully.
"Mama made chili for dinner, and you know she makes a powerful chili."

"Ssh!"
Maddy elbowed him again.
"Go to sleep.
And don't do that again.
The Mire's going to be stinky enough."

Silence,
and then Gumption asked quietly,
"Do you really think we'll find him?
Your pa, I mean."

"I know who you mean."
It was Maddy's turn to be silent for a moment.
"I don't know.
But I gotta try."
She found his hand in the darkness and squeezed it.
"Thanks for coming with me."

Gumption squeezed back.
"Thanks for bringing me.
I'd be stuck at home otherwise,
and,
well,
everybody had the same chili I did."

Maddy let go of his hand.
"Do you ever take *anything* seriously?" she asked.

Gumption shrugged,
very aware of how warm she was beside him
and of how clean her fur smelled.
"Always taken *you* seriously," he said.
"'Cept for that time you tried skating on Weaver's Pond.
You remember that?"
He tsk'ed.
"That was truly spectacular."

He rolled onto his side and propped his head up on his arm.
"But other than that,
and the time you tried make double-dip cookies but forgot the salt,
and maybe a couple of other things,
I've pretty much always taken you seriously.
So don't worry—if he's there,
you'll find him,
and if you find him,
I know you'll bring him home.
Now get some sleep—we got a lot in front of us."

He lay back down.
When Maddy said, "Eww!" again a moment later,
he smiled in the darkness.

*Click waited for their breathing to slow.
It was less intelligent on its own than it was
when it was joined with the hive,
but its task tonight was simple.
There: the two organics matched its profile of "asleep" with ninety-eight percent accuracy.
It climbed out of their hiding place onto the top of the wagon
and flashed its eyes in a rapid pattern.*

*Flashes answered from the bushes opposite the barn.
Click waited,
then flashed its eyes again impatiently.
"Has gone dormant must restart,"
came the response.*

*A minute later the GearHive's other hexabot scuttled onto the road.
A sleepy Sindy Roo followed it with her school satchel on her shoulder,
rubbing her eyes with one hand.
She climbed the wagon's sideboards,
pausing each time they creaked,
and slid into the space Click had made sure was waiting for her.
"Thank you," she mouthed before laying her head on her satchel
and closing her eyes.*

*Click watched her for a moment,
then turned to its partner.
The hexabot flashed its lights in a pattern
that could most accurately be translated as,
"Imperative: function correctly [affectionate overtones]."
Click flashed an acknowledgment and crawled back into its hiding place.*

## Stowaways

Maddy woke two hours later
when the wagon hit a pothole
and the bump knocked her sideways onto Gumption.
"Mmph?" the goat mumbled.

"Ssh!"
She clamped her hand over his mouth.
Her mouth tasted *awful*,
and her neck—she realized that she had never really appreciated pillows properly before.

Gumption wriggled out from under her
and peered between the boxes that hid them.
"I can't see anything,"
he whispered.
"Oh wait, there's Mama Tumbly an' a couple of other folk.
Is she wavin' flag?
Tarnation,
if that ain't the dumbest thing I ever seen."

"Ssh!"
Maddy hissed again.
The bits of straw and what-not in the bottom of the wagon were itchy.
She desperately wanted to give herself a good all-over scratch,
but not in front of Gumption.

Something plucked at her skirt.
"What?"
she whispered.

"What?"
Gumption whispered back.

"What do you want?"

"I don't want anything."

"Then why are you—oh dithers."
It was the hexabot.
Sometime during the night it had crawled into the wagon with them.

"Huh.
Go figure."
Gumption rolled onto his back and pillowed his arms beneath his head.
A moment later he started snoring softly.

Maddy sighed.
The hexabot's eyes were triangles of glowing blue-green dots,
and they were definitely staring at her.
"Well, wake us up when we get somewhere."
She settled down beside Gumption.
"Or if they stop for a toilet break,"
she added,
wishing that she had thought just a little further ahead.

An hour out of town
the dirt road they were on joined the Makers' road.
The ancient black surface of the highway was cracked in places,
and Able had to swerve around fallen branches
and clumps of weeds tough enough to have broken through the road,
but even so
they went fast enough that Maddy could feel their speed.
It reminded her of her first time on the road months ago,
when she and Dockety had chased the raiders who had kidnapped Sindy.

They passed under a row of ruined arches that marched from one horizon to the other,
crumbling but still solid.
A half-sunken metal sphere as big as a house was next,
and then a tangle of concrete and bent bars
that the villagers just called "the thing".

The ground on either side of the highway began to grow damp.
The twin smells of rust and rotting vegetation filled Maddy's nose
as they entered the polluted swamp known as the Mire.
Somewhere out there was the bunker
where Patient in Darkness had kept her father and other prisoners—where
she and Sindy had almost spent wound up as prisoners too.
Dockety and the other free bots had tried to salvage its riches,
but whatever it was that lurked in the swamp nearby was still there,
and in the end the task had proven too risky.

*And now we're headed into somewhere a hundred times bigger,*
Maddy thought despondently.
Stowing away seemed like a worse idea with every passing hour,
and she *really* needed a toilet break.

The sun was high in the sky when they turned off the Makers' road
onto a smaller one.
It had once been paved as well,
but time, weather, and tree roots had all done patient damage.
What had once been two smooth lanes with knee-high concrete barriers on each side
was now a stream bed in some places
and a jigsaw puzzle in others.
The road climbed, dipped, and climbed again
until finally they reached the summit of a tall hill overlooking the Mire.

A single building stood there,
its domed metal roof stained with rust but still intact.
The ground in front of it had once been paved like the road,
but was now home to scattered stands of larch and pine.
The waist-high bushes between the trees were dry and brittle,
and the grass below them brown instead of green.

"Whoa up!"
Meribeth called.
Able slowed and stopped.
The bear and Thoughtful hopped down from their seats at the front of the wagon.
Pressing her face against a gap in the slats,
Maddy saw Special Blazes climb down from atop Bee Six Vee.

The tiger arched his back and rolled his head from side to side,
then consulted a heavy pocket watch.
"Four hours," he declared.
"Thoughtful, you take first watch.
Everyone else,
eat up or recharge as you need.
He turned to someone Maddy couldn't see.
"This would be a good time for your little friend to scout ahead."

"Noted,"
Dockety replied in its buzzing voice.
Maddy shrank back reflexively as the bot came into view,
walking straight toward the wagon.
It paused right in front of her.

"Stay hidden,"
it said quietly
before extending its legs
so that it could reach the solar panels stacked in the back of the wagon.

Maddy gave Gumption a wide-eyed look.
"What?" he mouthed silently.

She pulled him close.
"It knows we're here," she whispered in his ear.

Gumption stared at her for a moment,
then shrugged helplessly.

It only took the travelers a minute to settle in.
Dockety laid out the solar panels in a line
near the edge of the turnaround they were parked on,
connecting one cable to their batteries and the others to itself,
Able,
and Bee Six Vee.
Thoughtful unfolded a camp chair
and took a moment to assemble a long-barrelled rifle on a tripod,
then sat down and began scanning the road below them
through its telescopic sight
in smooth, unhurried sweeps.
Maddy couldn't see where Meribeth and Special Blazes went,
but the bear's snoring told her they hadn't gone far.

She held on as long as she could,
but finally whispered to Gumption,
"I gotta get out for a minute."

"Me too," he said, grimacing.
"But they'll see us for sure."

Slowly,
wincing with every slight bump and scrape,
they pulled one of the boards to the side
and unfastened the loose slat on the back of the wagon.
Maddy looked at the narrow gap despondently.
She would have to slither out head first
and hope that she could somehow right herself
before she fell on the ground.
On the bright side,
there was a thick stand of bushes just a few strides away.

She poked her head out cautiously.
No one was in sight.
Digging her elbows into the boards,
she dragged herself forward until she could reach the hitch
at the back of the wagon.
If she braced herself on that—

"Would you like a hand getting down?"
Special Blazes asked,
coming around the corner with a freshly-brewed cup of tea in his hand.
He nodded,
solemn-faced,
at Maddy's polite,
"No thank you,"
and sipped his tea as she lowered herself awkwardly to the ground,
stood,
and brushed her skirt back into place.

"Must've been mighty warm in there,"
he observed.

"It wasn't so bad.
Um, if you'll excuse me a moment…?"

"By all means."
The Regulator stepped aside.

Back straight and head held high,
Maddy got three steps toward the bushes when a small voice said,
"Can I go too?
'Cuz I *really* need to."

"Sindy!?" Maddy blurted in disbelief
as her sister lifted the lid of the box she had been hiding in.
"What in the Makers' names do you think you're doing,
hiding yourself away like that?
It's dangerous out here!
You shouldn't—oh, hush up!"
She put her hands on her hips
and glared at Special Blazes until the Regulator stopped chuckling.

"Sorry about that," he said unapologetically.
"You best come down and take care of what you need to, Miz Roo.
And you too, young fella.
Do your business and then come along by the front and we'll have a chat."

Five minutes later Maddy, Sindy, and Gumption had joined the rest of the party,
who were sitting or standing near the front of the wagon
depending on their inclination and body shape.
"Your choice is reckless.
You will not be safe.
You must return home."
Dockety sounded as angry as Maddy had ever heard it.

"I agree with my friend here,"
Special Leaf said.
*he looks tired,*
Maddy thought.
*He doesn't belong here any more than Sindy does.*

Special Blazes shook his head.
"We're not turning around.
And they can't go back on their own,"
he went on,
raising his voice slightly to forestall Dockety and Special Leaf's protests.
"We're too close to the Mire."

"Sure as shootin' they'd be somethin' come crawl up outta the muck,"
Thoughtful agreed
without pausing his slow, careful scan of the horizon.

Special Leaf took off his glasses
and breathed on them.
"They could stay here,"
he suggested,
nodding at the domed building nearby
as he wiped his glasses with the tail of his shirt.
"It was solid enough the last time I passed through."

Meribeth spat on the ground.
"Makers' work ain't for the likes of children," she grumbled.

"We're not children,"
Maddy started to protest,
but Special Blazes cut her off.

"Why'n't you all go give it a look-over and then we can decide?
You can give 'em a look at Heck while you're there if they want."
The tiger rolled his head to loosen his neck.
"I'll get the hot plate going."

A sign stood in front of the building,
but time and weather had long since made it mute.
There was just enough room between its double doors for Special Leaf to squeeze through.
The children followed one by one.

Special Leaf handed them each a glowball,
then held up his own.
Its cool blue-white light threw sharp shadows.
Maddy shivered.
The last place like this that she had been in
had been Patient's bunker in the Mire.
The air here was cool and dry instead of dank,
but their steps echoed in exactly the same way on the tiled floor.

"Stay close,"
Special Leaf said.
"I want to show you something."
He led them along the corridor
past rooms with broken-down doors
whose contents had long since been salvaged.
Every few paces they passed pillars
that Maddy realized must once have been display cases.

The corridor took them to a broad flight of stairs.
Up they went into a room that filled the entire second story of the building.
Daylight poured through a wide gap in the domed roof
to reveal something that looked like a metal log lying on the floor.
Someone had swept the scattering of dry leaves and twigs around it into piles.

"What is that?"
Maddy asked.

"It was a telescope,"
Special Leaf explained.
"The Makers used to like to look at the stars.
Here, you see?"
He walked around to one end.
"Once upon a time there would have been a lens in there,
so if you sat in the chair back there
you could look at—well,
pretty much anything."
He sighed.
"It would have been quite something.
But that's not what I wanted to show you.
Look here."

He picked his way past the piled-up leaves
to a window positioned under the gap in the roof.
A boxy wooden bench stood beneath the window.
With a grunt,
Special Leaf lifted the bench seat and propped it open,
then reached inside and pulled out a cylinder the length of his arm.
A few moments later,
the telescope that had been waiting inside the cylinder
stood on a little tripod.

"You've been here before, haven't you?"
Maddy said as Special Leaf pointed the telescope through the broken window
and fiddled with the lens on the viewing end.

"Been a lot of places,"
he replied absently.
"Here, have a look."

It took Maddy a moment to line her eye up with the lens properly.
She gasped.
In the distance she could see dozens of windowless brick building connected by elevated walkways.
Pipes and cables ran here and there,
and every third building seemed to have an antenna,
cooling tower,
or incomprehensible piece of machinery on its roof.
She was looking at the bot city.
She was looking at Heck.

"Where are they all?"
she asked as Gumption took his turn.

Special Leaf shrugged.
"They don't need to go to school or go shopping or the like—surprising how much rushing around
you don't have to do
if you don't have to do any of that."

"I thought it'd be smoky an' all,"
Gumption offered,
relinquishing the telescope to Sindy.
"Like in the stories."

Special Leaf shrugged again.
"Some people say the Makers left because the world had become too dirty for them to live in.
Others say the Makers were the ones who made it that way.
Whichever story you like,
the bots they left behind tend to like things tidy."

They each took another turn,
but the empty streets were too unnerving to watch for long.
*Papa's down there somewhere,* Maddy thought despondently.
*I hope he's aright.*

They made their way back to the others in silence.
As they approached,
Special Blazes held up a kettle.
"Just boiled if you want some,"
he said.

Before they could answer,
Thoughtful's foot thumped against the ground in a rapid *pat-a-tat-tat*.
He swung his long rifle back a few degrees,
then let loose a string of profanity that set Maddy's ears back against her head.
"Trouble, boss,"
he said urgently.
"Three uglies airborne,
comin' fast!"

## The Observatory

Special Blazes put two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly.
Meribeth jerked upright and rubbed her eyes.
"Wuzza?"

"Wake them up,"
Special Blazes ordered crisply,
pointing at Able and Bee Six Vee.
"Then get these three into the trees and sit on them."
He turned to the teenagers.
"You do exactly what she says,
no more and no less.
Understood?"

"And you."
He pointed at Dockety.
"Back down to the main road.
No, no, no arguing.
Down to the main road and eyes wide.
You see anything bigger than a butterfly
you get back up here right away and let us know.
Being ambushed would truly ruin my day."

"Wait!"
Gumption protested.
"Where's Flowers?"

The tiger and Special Leaf exchanged looks.
"If it's smart or got lucky, it's halfway home by now," Special Leaf said.
"If not…"
He closed his eyes a moment.
When he opened them again there was a hardness there that Maddy had never seen before.
"This isn't a story.
Go find cover,
do exactly what the Regulator tells you to,
and *don't* try to help."

He raised pulled back his sleeves.
The tech on his arms lit up as he concentrated.
The ground rumbled and heaved as he pulled it apart to make a foxhole,
no,
a trench,
waist-deep with a mounded wall in front of it.
Special Blazes clapped him on the shoulder.
Thoughtful just touched the brim of his hat and slid in,
his rifle cradled in his arms.

Crouching behind a stand of dwarf larch trees a few moments later,
Maddy could smell the dry earth under her feet,
Meribeth's sweaty fur on one side,
and the cheap soap that Papa Gumption used on his children's clothes on the other.
The bear had a small cannon in her hands
and a pair of wicked-looking hatchets on her belt.
Her scowl told Gumption that questions wouldn't be welcome
even if he had any more sensible than,
"will we be aright?"

The flying bots' rotors whined and then shrieked as they dove at the camp.
Bright sparks danced across their bellies.
Gumption heard the *rat a tat tat* of their guns a moment later.
Puffs of dirt spattered from the ground.

*Chonk!*
A white streak shot up from the trench Special Leaf had made.
Thoughtful's shot went straight through one of the attackers.
The bot tumbled end over end before breaking apart.
"That's one,"
Meribeth muttered as the smoldering fragments fell.

The two remaining bots shot away in different directions,
circled around,
and came in for a second pass at right angles to each other.
The earth rumbled again as Special Leaf heaved another wall out of the ground.

*Chonk!*
Thoughtful's second shot nicked one of the bots off center.
Its rotors whined as it vainly tried to right itself
before crashing into the trees
and exploding with a muffled *whump!*

"That's two!" Gumption whooped.

But even as he spoke,
Dockety came racing back up the road on its single wheel.
"Alarm! Alarm!" it blared.
"Marauders approach!
We shall soon be under further attack!"

"Knew it,"
Meribeth growled,
hefting her little cannon.
"They always—"

She stopped mid-sentence and sniffed the air.
"Makers' names,"
she cursed.
"If it ain't one thing."

The acrid tang of smoke tickled Gumption's nose.
The bot that had just crashed—it must have set the dry brush alight!
"The water tank!"
Gumption pointed at the wagon.
"I'll grab some buckets!
We can—"

"You can stay right where you are!"
Meribeth snapped.
"If we're still here in five minutes
we can worry about the fire then."

The third flying bot raced away.
The earth split under the force of Special Leaf's tech.
Zig-zag cracks appeared in the hard-packed road.
*He can't keep doing this,* Gumption thought,
but the old tortoise didn't let up.
He swept his arms from side to side,
each slow pass creating dips and hummocks in the ground.

One breath, two, and the attacking bots came around the corner.
These weren't rag-tag machines
like the ones Patient in Darkness had cobbled together out of spare parts.
These were weapons.
The small six-wheeled scouts in front were almost as fast as the flying bots had been.
The two behind them were as large as Bee Six Vee,
squat and heavily armored,
with four wheeled legs for speed
and two crab arms for fighting.

*Chonk!*
Thoughtful's shot pinged off one of the crab tanks.
*Chonk!*
His second shot knocked one of the little scout bots into the air.
It hit the ground,
righted itself,
and rejoined the attack.

The ground shook and split.
The lead crab tank braked hard but couldn't stop itself.
It tumbled head-first into the fissure Special Leaf had made.
The earth shook again as the fissure closed on it.

Almost immediately one of its armored claws punched up out of the ground.
The second claw followed.
The crab tank heaved itself back into the world,
pulling its legs free one by one.
It shook itself like a wet cat and rolled implacably forward.

*Crack!*
A scout bot exploded,
sending scraps of metal flying in all directions.
The fireball that Special Blazes had thrown
left a dazzling after-image on Gumption's eyes.
The other scouts scattered in all directions like a flock of startled chickens.

But "in all directions" meant "toward the trees".
Gumption grabbed Maddy's arm and was about to yell, "Run!"
when Meribeth fired her hand cannon.

*Boom!*
A wire spiderweb burst wide in the air and wrapped around the scout bot.
The wires sparked and sizzled.
The bot careened off course,
crashed into a tree,
and toppled over on its side to lie still.

*Szzt!*
Special Blazes' second fireball missed its target.
It bounced across the broken ground and evaporated unnoticed.
Another fireball,
then another,
and then the first crab tank was climbing the mounded wall
that Special Leaf had made.

*We're done for!*
Gumption thought,
panic rising in his throat.

But he had reckoned without Bee Six Vee.
The mulebot slammed into the attacker's side
with a clang he was sure they must have heard
all the way back in Rusty Bridge.
As the crab tank scrabbled to regain its footing,
Special Blazes punched forward with both hands
to send a stream of fire straight into its joints.

One second, two…
Smoke and flame burst out of the rear of the crab tank.
Bee Six Vee rammed it again.
Its legs crumpled beneath it and it lay still.

*Boom!*
Meribeth fired again,
bringing down a scout that Maddy hadn't even seen.
"Stay here!"
the bear bellowed,
sprinting into the clearing
to press herself against the back of the wagon.
She kicked the blocks away from its rear wheels,
put her shoulder against the backboard,
and pushed.

The wagon began to roll forward slowly—too slowly.
Swallowing hard,
Gumption ran forward and put his shoulder against the backboard.
The wagon begain picking up speed as he and the bear pushed.
Meribeth tossed her hand cannon into the back,
pulled one of the hatchets off her belt,
and brought it down hard into the back of a scout bot
as it charged at her.

*Chonk!*
*Crack!*
Shots and fireballs kept the remaining scouts at bay,
but not the second crab tank.
It grabbed Bee Six Vee and staggered around
to put the mulebot between it and Special Blazes.
Metal shrieked as the crab tank's claws tightened.
The mulebot's legs left gouges in the ground as it was pushed back,
closer and closer to the defenders' trench.

*Thud!*
A pillar of earth punched up out of the ground
directly beneath the crab tank.
It was only airborne for a moment,
but a moment was all Bee Six Vee needed.
The mulebot rolled to the side,
flipping the crab tank onto its back.
Special Blazes raised his hands
and poured fire into its joints.

Gumption whooped as the last of the scout bots fled.
"Did you see that!?" he yelled to Maddy and Sindy.

Meribeth's hand came down on his shoulder.
"Somethin's wrong,"
she said,
pointing at the trench.

Gumption reached it a few moments after her.
Special Leaf blinked up at him.
"It's… not as bad… as it looks," the old tortoise wheezed.

"No it ain't,"
Thoughtful said,
folding a length of linen bandage
and pressing it against the spreading red stain on Special Leaf's chest.
"It's worse."

Special Blazes swore under his breath.
"Do what you can,"
he said curtly.
"Bee! Meri! Load up!
Looks like we're turning around after all."

Special Leaf coughed wetly.
"Sorry, boss—I don't think we got that long,"
Thoughtful said quietly.

Special Blazes glared at the nearest crab bot.
"What in the Makers' names were they doing this far out?"
he demanded of the air,
and then,
"What?
Who in the galloping garbage piles are you?"

The hexabot tugged at his trouser leg again.
"It came with us,"
Gumption said.

Special Blazes turned his glare on the young goat.
"Did anyone *not* stow away on this trip?"
he demanded.

The hexabot tugged Special Blazes' trouser leg again
and pointed its other claw toward the observatory.
"I think it's telling us there's a fire,"
Gumption offered.
"From when the flyer crashed."

"Well go and deal with it!"
Special Blazes roared.
He jabbed a finger at Dockety.
"You go with him.
Everyone else,
pack up and get ready to move!"

Halfway to the observatory,
the hexabot's eyes began to flash.
Dockety pulled up short.
"This one says the fire is not spreading,"
it said.
"It says that it has a more important mission for us.
It wants us to go into the building."

"What?
Why?
There's nothing in there but a telescope,"
Gumption protested.

Click's eyes flashed again.
"It says there is more,"
Dockety translated.
"It says it can help Special Leaf."

Gumption hesitated.
"Aright," he said.
"But just for a minute.
We gotta check the fire out no matter what it says."

They didn't have Special Leaf's glowballs,
but Dockety still had its chest light.
Its bright yellow beam let Gumption pick his way down the long corridor.
He tried hard to ignore the dark holes in the walls
that had once held doors,
and tried even harder not to think about what might be lurking in them.

When they reached the stairs,
Click scuttled around them and tapped on a small door.
Gumption caught his breath as something tapped back.
Click's eyes flashed.
"If you say so," Dockety replied.
The bot tapped a code into the lock panel on the door.

*Clunk.*
Gumption jumped as a heavy lock disengaged.
Dockety pushed the door open and shone its light inside,
then reached inside to flip a switch.

Light spilled from the room into the corridor.
A moment later,
a handful of rectangular panels flickered to life above their heads.

Dockety turned to Gumption.
"Go tell the regulator we have found something.
Tell him to bring Special Leaf.
Proceed with haste."

Gumption ran.

Meribeth carried Special Leaf to the observatory.
Dockety met them at the door.
"It is quite remarkable," the bot said.
It led them back to the door under the stairs
and through it into a room almost as large
as the one above it.
Machines and cabinets lined the walls,
dusty but unbroken.

"Boots and biscuits,"
Thoughtful said, wide-eyed.
"I ain't never—boss, look at all o' this!"

"Certainly is convenient,"
Special Blazes said levelly,
eyeing Click.
The little hexabot scuttled around behind Dockety.
"Any of it useful?"

The rabbit took a deep breath.
"Sure hope so.
Meribeth,
you put him on that table there.
The rest o' you shoo.
I got work to do."
