## Stolen Arms

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the center of the village square
when she heard one of the Ox brothers holler,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were all in exactly the right places,
but the lines on the page still didn't look anything like
the drooping greenery in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made
for her tenth birthday—the last one she'd had
before he was kidnapped by marauding bots.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now they knew he might still be alive.

"Waitin' on anything in particular?"
a familar voice drawled behind her.

Maddy jumped, startled.
Mayor Lupus smiled down at her from the porch behind her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of wolfish teeth.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and—"

"—and it's a beautiful sunny day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're getting a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
The mayor had a way of looking at people that made them feel like she could read their mind.
Special Leaf said that was a big part of why the village had re-elected her so many times:
just about everyone who might have run against her felt guilty just thinking about it.

She sat on the steps of the mayor's house as a double handful of people gathered
to share gossip and small talk as they waited for the mail to arrive.
Zeke Bear had finally finished fixing the wall of the smokehouse
that had been knocked down during the bot attack a few months ago.
He still wasn't happy about the bots who'd helped save them living in the village,
"Not that they're actually 'living'," he added.
But even he would admit that Crusher could lift twice as much
as the Ox brothers put together.
And they were certainly handy for fixing things up in general—the apple orchard
was draining properly for the first time in who knew how long,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in town.

"I'd just feel more comfortable about it if they'd let us pay them,"
Mama Tumbly sighed.
"Makes me uncomfortable, taking charity from a bot."

Mayor Lupus swallowed the last of her tea
and tipped the dregs into the planter by her elbow.
"I reckon they figure being allowed to settle in beside us is payment enough,"
she said conversationally.
"Between that and getting first look at whatever salvage comes down the river,
I imagine they've got everything they want and a lot more than they used to.
And if any trouble shows up, well…"
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
"Fighting bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side."

Mama Tumbly's whiskers twitched slightly under the rebuke.
She had put herself forward for election the year before last,
but had garnered even fewer votes than Mayor Lupus's previous challenger.
"A lot of folks do think it's time for a change,"
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
"But if she's what that change looks like, they'd rather wait."

"Anyway, there it is, right on time,"
Mayor Lupus said, pointing as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six ("but call me Able") looked like three metal boxes
perched preciously on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two larger spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many of Rusty Bridge's refugee bots it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but someone had made it a blue hat with a little tin badge,
and Maddy thought it might just be the happiest bot in the world.

Able bumped across the cobblestones,
braked,
backed up,
turned,
and doffed its hat.
"Good morning, one and all," it said jauntily,
replacing its hat and reaching around to open a hatch in its side.
"Got letters, got parcels, even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend."
Its periscope eyes swivelled one way and another as it began handing out what it had brought.

Someone bumped Maddy's elbow.
"Hey,"
Gumption said.

"Hey," she said back.
He had slicked back his fur again like some of the older goats, she noticed.
It made them look tough,
but on Gumption—she sighed to herself.
It had taken him months to heal after the attack.
Once he was back on his feet he'd started using the punching bag
in the yard beside the village school
and doing militia drills with a home-made pike.
Secretly she had hoped that this would be the summer they went blackberry picking together,
just the two of them,
but "together" seemed to be the last thing on his mind.

Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
"Anything for you?"

She was about to say, "Not yet,"
when Able called her name.
She traded a square glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope.
"Miz Madalena Roo, Resident in Rusty Bridge" was written in strong square letters on its front,
and a blue circle with Able's dot-and-dash ID inside it showed that it had been collected in good order.

Maddy took a deep breath.
"Well? You going to open it?"
Gumption asked.

She shook her head.
"Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?"

Gumption shrugged.
"Sure.
Has he got Sindy doin' magic tricks again?"

"Ssh!"
Maddy glanced around involuntarily,
but nobody was listening.
Only family and Gumption and a couple of bots knew about her sister's special ability,
and Special Leaf was adamant that they keep it that way as long as they could.
"Never borrow trouble from tomorrow," he had said firmly
when Mama Roo had suggested that they at least let the mayor know.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Sorry," he muttered,
and then,
"Hey—look!"

Heads turned.
A murmur ran through the crowd.
"What in tarnation?" Mayor Lupus exclaimed
as two bots entered the square with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.

Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it marched toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on its heavy treads,
and in between—

"Are those boys *tied up*?"
Mama Tumbly gasped,
her ears standing straight up in shock.

"Quiet down," Mayor Lupus said sharply as the murmuring turned to muttering.
The crowd parted to let her through.

She rapped her cane on the cobblestones.
"Morning," she said loudly,
"I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems you all have something for us as well."

The lenses on the front of Dockety's head rotated a quarter turn
and then snapped back into position
with a faint *zick zick*.
"These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take possession of items that do not belong to them,"
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"We request punitive measures be taken to deter a repeat of such attempts."

Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
"Is that right, boys?
Were you stealing?"

"We weren't stealin'!"
Bluster said vehemently.
"We were just tryin' to find out if they've been hidin' stuff from everyone,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!"

"I said quiet down!" Mayor Lupus snapped as the muttering started again.
"That's a pretty serious accusation, Bluster Goat.
You best be sure of your ground before you go making it."

"Bravo seen 'em too," Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
"Big pile of stuff laid out in one of those sheds they built.
All kinds tools and wires and stuff."

"Those are not weapons,"
Dockety buzzed.
"They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs."

"Spare parts my tail!" Bluster said hotly.
"They got a thing that looks like a zap gun,
and a buzz saw blade and all kinds.
They put 'em all together one night while we're sleepin'
and we'll all be in cage carts by sun-up!"

"Dockety?
Any of that true?"
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
but Maddy saw the way the mayor's ears flattened.

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"These ones possess several saw blades," the bot acknowledged.
It gestured at Crusher.
"This one has been using one of them to clear brush,
and it needed sharpening."

"And the zap gun?"

"It is not operational," Dockety said.
"But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes."

"Says *you*," someone said just loudly enough to be heard.

Mayor Lupus rapped her cane on the cobblestones.
"Operational or not,
it would have been neighborly of you to let us know you had that."

"Noted," Dockety said.
"We will do so in future."

"And you two,"
the mayor continued,
turning a cold glare on the goat twins.
"It's not your business to be poking around in other folks' business.
No,
no,
don't interrupt me,
that's just going to make me cranky.
They all have just as much right to be here now as anyone,
and more than you do if you keep practicing nonsense like this.
You're both on ditch duty for the next month,
and if I sniff so much as a whiff of you doing something this lump stupid again,
I promise you'll be looking back on ditches like they were your first summer love.
You got that?"

Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when Bravo kicked the side of his leg.
"Yes'm," he said sullenly.

"Yes'm," his twin echoed.

"All right then.
Untie them—they won't bother you again."

"Thank you."
Bluster took an involuntary step back as Dockety spun around,
then glared at the bot as its mis-matched hands undid the knots
that held his arms in place.

"Let's get out of here," he snapped at his brother
once the other goat was free.
They stalked off side by side,
their boots clomping in time on the cobblestones.

"Those two make me *so* mad!"
Maddy grouched to Gumption as the crowd began to break up.
"They'd both be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren't for Dockety."

"I guess,"
Gumption said noncommittally,
scuffing his boot on the cobblestones.

"You don't think so?"
Maddy demanded hotly.

"I didn't say that!"
Gumption protested.
"But—Mama Tumbly was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all saying that
we don't really know much about them.
I'm not not saying I agree,"
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy's outrage.
"But she was saying—Mama Tumbly, I mean—that they call us 'breathers'."

"Well we call 'em a lot worse than that,"
Maddy snapped.

Gumption threw up his hands.
"I don't!
I like having 'em here, you know that.
I'm just saying a lot of folks aren't as quick with change as you,
that's all."

They walked the rest of the way to Special Leaf's house in silence.
It was a warm day,
and other circumstances Maddy would have suggested taking the long way around,
but she was angry and it would have been awkward
and why did everything have to be so *complicated*?

She knocked on Special Leaf's front door
and opened it without waiting to be invited in.
The Special had already been old before Maddy and Gumption were born,
but the battle with the bots had put even more wrinkles on his green-gray skin.
His eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses,
though,
and he always seemed glad to see them.

"Done for the day?"
Maddy asked her sister,
ruffling the patch of fur on top of Sindy's head.

"Just let me finish this chapter,"
Sindy pleaded without looking up.

"You're welcome to take it with you,"
Special Leaf said gently.

"But this is the most exciting part!
Please?"

Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
"Five minutes,"
Maddy said sternly.
Special Leaf caught her eye and nodded his head sideways toward the kitchen.

Maddy followed him into the other room.
"How's she doing?" she asked.

"Very well,"
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
"I came by this up years ago.
Never knew if it was tech or just a paperweight,
but she picked it up this morning
and all of a sudden it was full of pictures.
And not just any pictures,"
he added,
unable to keep the excitement out of his voice.
"They were all things from the book she was reading.
It was almost like it had been listening to her.
It was remarkable,"
he finished wistfully.

"That's great," Maddy said brightly,
though she still wasn't completely sure that it was.
Her sister was one of those rare people who didn't look like either of their parents.
She no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for a wiry black tuft on the top of her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but almost every piece of tech she touched responded to her.
Being able to use just one was enough for someone to be called "special".
Maddy was happy for her sister,
she really was,
but every time she thought about what would happen
when the rest of the village—when the rest of the *world*—found out,
her stomach went a little queasy.

Gumption elbowed her.
"Aren't you going to tell him?"

Special Leaf wrinkles his forehead,
which was as close as he could get to raising his nonexistent eyebrows.
Maddy scowled sidelong at Gumption,
then reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
"Mm," Special Leaf said.
"I was wondering when that would arrive."
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddie.

"What's this for?" she asked.

"If it's good news, for celebrating," Special Leaf said.
"And if it's not,
well,
a cookie won't fix anything,
but it won't make it worse either."

Gumption elbowed her again.
"Just open it."

Maddy swallowed drily.
With a sudden motion she tore the envelope open
and unfolded the single beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.
She blinked furiously,
angry at the sudden tears in her eyes.

"Aw, muck," Gumption said.
He patted her awkwardly on the shoulder.
"I'm sorry, Maddy."

She shook her head.
"No.
No.
They—"
She laughed shakily.
"They said yes.
They're going to publish it.
They're going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!"

She hugged Gumption impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf with a grin as wide as a sunrise on her face.
"Congratulations," he said as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.

## The Prosecutors

Gumption woke up the next morning
to the sound of raindrops
spattering on the cottonwood outside his attic bedroom.
He lay on his narrow cot for a moment,
then rubbed the sleep from his eyes and thought,
*Of course.*
He was supposed to spend the day weeding the vegetable garden.
It wasn't the worst job in the world,
but even if he wore his father's waxed cotton slicker
his fur would get soaked and muddy.

The gray light coming through the shutter on the attic's one small window
matched his mood perfectly.
He was happy for Maddy,
he really was.
She wanted to be an artist more than anything in the world.
Having one of her drawing published in a newspaper
was almost as a big a deal for her
as saving Rusty Bridge from a band of marauding bots.
It was great news,
and if it got her thinking about something other than
her bug-brained schemes to sneak into Heck and rescue her father,
well,
that was great too.

But it also meant she was that much closer to leaving Rusty Bridge
for somewhere better—somewhere with people as smart and as talented as she was.
He'd known since their first conversation about books at Special Leaf's house
that she would leave some day,
and that day had been getting closer
ever since she had confided in him about her sister.
They couldn't hide Sindy's special powers forever,
and once folks knew,
the whole family would be off to Headling or Port Rough or,
or—

His stomach rumbled.
"Oh, shut up," he muttered,
kicking the blanket down to the foot of his cot and sitting up.
His breath caught in his throat as his ribs twinged.
Doctor Ganesh said he'd mended well,
but every once in a while
he would turn his head the wrong way or reach for spoon
and something inside him would catch
like a door sticking slightly before opening.

He dressed carefully and climbed six steps down the ladder
into the hallway below
as quietly as he could.
His little sister and brother were still asleep,
and he'd catch it if he woke them.
His hooves clicked softly on the stairs that took him to the main floor
where his mother and grandmother were peeling potatoes
while his father and one of his uncles cleaned, oiled, and reassembled
a set of box hinges.
Other families would have given the work to Dockety and his bots,
but other families could afford to.
Maddy's was one of the few that had to be as careful about making ends meet as Gumption's.
Sometimes,
late at night,
he wondered if they actually had anything more than that in common.

He had just put a pot of porridge on the stove
when something clattered outside.
His uncle looked up.
"That'll be Zeke headin' out,"
his father grunted,
but then a high-pitched voice squealed from upstairs.

"Mama!
Mama!
Outside!
Outside on the road!"

Gumption's mother opened the door.
Her hand flew to her mouth.
"What? What's going on?" Gumption asked,
squeezing past her to look.

There were four travelers on the road,
each one looking more dangerous than the last.
Gumption's first thought was, *Bandits!*
But then the rabbit at the front shifted the long rifle on her shoulder
to wave at them.
Gumption's mother raised a tentative hand and waved back.

The six-legged mulebot beside the rabbit had a squat turret for a head
and armor that put Special Leaf's shell to shame.
Behind them was a tiger,
an actual tiger with a black patch over one eye and a sword slung on his hip.
A bear carrying almost as many weapons as the mulebot brought up the rear.
She wore the same dark green jackets with black collars and cuffs
as the rabbit and tiger,
while the mulebot was painted in matching camouflage.

A chill went up Gumption's spine.
They were Prosecutors!
And they were headed for Rusty Bridge!
*Sindy!* he thought.
Somehow they must have found out about Sindy.
He had to warn the Roos so they could—he didn't know what,
but *something*.

He squeezed back into the kitchen
just in time to trip over his little sister.
"Stay inside!" he ordered,
knowing she would disobey.

Ten steps and he was out the back door.
Twenty strides at a run and he was over the split cedar fence
that separated their farm from his uncle's.
A crow scolded him from a tree
as he swung himself over another fence
onto the dirt path that ran through the trees to town.
It was muddy from the overnight rain but he didn't slow down,
not even when his feet almost went out from under him
on a slippery patch near a stream so small
that even the children didn't have a name for it.

*Please be home,*
he thought desperately.
Mama Roo did laundry and other chores for half a dozen families in town to make ends meet,
which meant she got up early even by farmers' standards,
but Maddy and Sindy only helped out a couple of days a week.
Gumption had no idea if today was one of those days or not.
If it was he'd have no idea where to start looking for them,
so all he could do was hope it wasn't.

He had to slow down and walk to catch his breath twice
before he reached town
and once more before he got to Maddy's.
He felt a bit nauseous from hunger,
and he was pretty sure he had a blister—his hand-me-down boots
weren't made for running—but
he pushed that aside and knocked on their door,
then knocked again, harder.

"Just a tick!" Mama Roo called from inside.
Gumption pushed the door open without waiting.

"What the—oh, hello, Gumption," Mama Roo said,
wiping her hands on a dishcloth.
"I was just—what?
What's wrong?"

"P-Prosecutors,"
Gumption panted,
getting the word out on the second try.
"A bunch of Prosecutors just come up along Makers Road past our place
headin' toward town."
He waved more or less in the direction of the village.

Mama Roo's eyes widened.
"Prosecutors?
Are you sure?"

Gumption nodded breathlessly.
"They were wearin' uniforms and carryin' all kinds of gear,
and Miz Roo,
one of 'em was a tiger,
an actual honest *tiger* with just one eye.
Miz Roo—what if they're comin' for Sindy?"

"Keep your voice down!"
Mama Roo pointed at the ceiling.
"The girls are still asleep."

"No I'm not."
Maddy slipped into the room as quietly as a puff of dandelion fuzz.
"But Sindy still is.
What's this about Prosecutors?"

Gumption quickly described the travelers.
"And he had an eyepatch, just like in the stories,"
he finished.

"That doesn't mean—"
Maddy started,
stopping when her mother raised a finger.

Mama Roo gnawed her lip for a moment.
"Aright," she said.
"We knew this day would come,
so I guess it's here.
I'll stay here with Sindy and—and pack up a few things,
just in case.
Maddy,
you head into town and find out what you can.
Gumption,
I can't ask you to do any more than you have, but—"

"I'll go with her,"
he said before Mama Roo could finish.
He forced a grin that he hoped was reassuring.

Mama Roo nodded.
"Thank you," she said,
and then to Gumption's embarrassment she kissed the top of his head.
"Thank you for everything.
And you,"
she continued briskly to her daughter.
"You are going straight back upstairs and combing your fur
before you go anywhere."

Five minutes and one whispered argument later
about whether Maddy should wear a coat in case the rain came back,
the two teenagers were out the door.
Mama Roo had given Gumption one of the previous day's biscuits
with some hummus and fresh-picked lettuce on it.
He ate it in three bites,
wishing he had some tea to wash it down
but knowing it would be the wrong time to ask.

"We should stop by Special Leaf's and get him on the way,"
Maddy said suddenly.

"Sure," Gumption nodded.
He definitely had a blister.
"They could just be passin' through, you know."

"They could,"
Maddy acknowledged.
The tone of her voice made clear
just how likely she thought that was.

Special Leaf wasn't home,
or was sleeping so soundly that he couldn't hear them knocking.
"Maybe we could go in an' see if he's here?"
Gumption suggested.

Maddy then shook her head.
"Let's just head down to the square.
Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen there."

They reached the square moments before the Prosecutors.
A double handful of townspeople were already milling around—Gumption
wasn't the only one who'd run ahead and spread word.
Mayor Lupus stood on the porch of the mayor's house
with her gnarlywood cane in her hand
and a serious expression on her face.
She had pinned both of her medals on her jacket as well,
Gumption noticed.
The last time she'd worn them had been
when she formally welcomed Dockety and the other bots.
The time before that had been
when she exiled one of the town bears for a year
for getting drunk and stabbing the older Ox brother with a pitchfork.

The sun broke through the clouds just as the Prosecutors arrived.
When Gumption thought about them afterward,
that was always the image that came to mind:
the one-eyed tiger and the rabbit in front,
the bear and the mulebot behind them,
all in a damp yellow glow.
The sunlight brought out the stains and damp patches on their uniform jackets,
but somehow that made them more intimidating rather than less.

When they were ten steps away from the steps of the mayor's house
the tiger whistled,
short and sharp.
The Prosecutors took two more steps each and halted,
still in formation.
A low murmur ran through the townspeople.

"Good morning," Mayor Lupus said,
inclining her head.
"And welcome to Rusty Bridge.
Been a while since we had official visitors."

"My apologies on that, miz mayor,"
the tiger replied cordially,
lisping slightly.
"Too many places to be and too few of us to be in them all.
You know how it is."

"No apologies needed, Special…?"
She flicked an ear to make it a question.

"Blazes," the tiger supplied.
"Special Blazes, miz mayor, at your service."

The crowd let out its collective breath.
"I *told* you," someone said,
just loud enough to be heard.
Someone else shushed them.

Gumption swallowed hard,
forgetting for a moment about Maddy and Sindy and everything else.
Special Blazes was *famous*.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
"The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!"
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half a Hat,
his year-long pursuit of the villainous Mattock sisters—Gumption
had read them all,
though "devoured" would have been more accurate.

He turned to Maddy to say, "It's him! It's really him!"
But then he saw the scowl on her face
and settled for, "Um, gosh," instead.

"Well,
Special,
it's an honor to have you here,"
Mayor Lupus said,
pitching her voice to carry.
"There's rooms inside for all of you
for as long as you need them.
Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?"

The elderly tortoise had somehow made his way to the front of the crowd
without anyone noticing.
He was wearing a thick, shapeless gray sweater
that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well.
He peered at the Prosecutors through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed to be shelved.

Special Blazes dipped his head deferentially.
"It's an honor, Special, truly an honor" he rumbled.
Beside him,
the rabbit doffed her hat and dipped her head as well.

"Thank you,"
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
"If you,
um,
well,
if you'd like tea at some point,
you'd be very, um…"
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.

Special Blazes dipped his head again.
"Thank you, we would enjoy that.
But I think what we'd like most right now is a chance to wash up."

The mulebot made a grinding noise.
The corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked.
"Or a wipe down and a bit of oil, if there's any to be had,"
he amended.
"And miz mayor,
if you can spare a bit of time for conversation,
we'd be grateful for that as well."

And just like that the little show was over.
Mayor Lupus waved the three flesh-and-blood Prosecutors inside
while the mulebot followed Zeke around to the back of the house.
The townspeople dithered and buzzed for a few moments,
but when the sky started spitting again
they decided in ones and twos that their chores weren't going to do themselves
and headed for home.

"You ever seen a Prosecutor before?"
Gumption asked Special Leaf.
"I mean, you must have," he corrected himself immediately.

The Special nodded.
"Not in some years," he said quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.

"Do you think—"
Maddy started.

"Sh."
The old tortoise shook his head slightly,
his eyes on the mayor's house.
"We don't know what to think yet,
so no point talking of what-ifs and maybes.
Especially not here,"
he added,
nodding slightly toward a small group of people still gossipping nearby.
"But if I may offer some advice?"

"Sure."
"'Course."
Gumption and Maddy said together when he paused for an answer.

Special Leaf adjusted his glasses.
"Be very, very careful what you say,
especially around Blazes.
He's every bit as smart as the stories say,
but he is not your friend."

## The Mouse and the Gears

Gumption went home after that—Prosecutors or no Prosecutors, he had chores to do.
Maddy walked part of the way with him in silence
before grunting a "see you later" and turning right instead of left where the path forked.

The excitement of knowing that the *Sandy Bend Chronicle* was going to publish her drawing had worn off,
leaving her feeling as drizzly and gray inside as the weather was outside.
It had been stupid to think that that the Prosecutors would just march into Rusty Bridge and say,
"We're taking Sindy Roo,"
without some kind of—of she didn't know what.
A trial or something,
but they would just *take* her.
And if they had,
what could she have done anyway?

"Let's figure out what's what before we worry about that," Mama Roo said firmly
when Maddy was done blurting this all out at the kitchen table.
"I have to talk to the Deers about that family portrait they want touched up
now that Eldon's antlers are coming in,
so I'll stop by Special Leaf's on the way back and see if he knows anything more.
Meanwhile,
you have a visitor."

Something warbled under the table.
Maddy felt a tentative poke at her ankle and smiled despite herself.
She leaned to the side to look under the table
and waggled her fingers in greeting.
"Hi, Mouse."

The little maintenance bot flashed its lights and bleeped back at her.
She was never sure how much it understood,
but it always seemed happy to see her.

Maddy reached down and held out a finger.
Mouse extended its single arm and tapped it,
then bleeped again and rolled away.
"It found your blue pencil," Mama Roo said, smiling.
"And a ball of hair the size of my soup pot."

"Must have been Sindy's," Maddy replied absently.

"Mm."
Her mother tousled her fur.
Maddy batted at her hand,
then held it for a moment.
"I'm glad you're both safe."

The rest of the day passed in the meandering way that rainy days often do.
Maddy and Sindy helped their mother wash clothes in the big tub on the back porch
and then hung them up to dry.
Potatoes were peeled and boiled,
a torn sleeve was carefully sewn up,
two games of checkers were played,
and then it was time for dinner and bed.

"Tell me a story about Papa,"
Sindy begged as Mama Roo tucked her in.
"Tell me the one about the time you two went dancing."

Maddy sat quietly on the stairs out of sight to listen
as her mother told the story.
She was old enough now to notice how the details sometimes changed,
but that didn't matter.
"And then he said, not with feet like these," she mouthed silently
in time with her mother
at the story's end.
There was a moment of quiet murmuring
and the sound of Mama Roo kissing her youngest daughter's forehead.
Maddy wiped her eyes and slipped quietly downstairs.

By the time her mother came down,
Maddy had opened her notebook and was sketching the outlines of the Prosecutors.
The tiger would have a fierce scowl, she thought.
The rabbit would be winking, and the bear—she wasn't sure about the bear yet,
but maybe she could be resting his elbow on the mulebot's back
and looking a little puzzled,
just like Zeke did whenever someone used too many big words.

Mama Roo was careful not to look over her daughter's shoulder
as she poured the last of the dinner-time tea into her cup and sat down.
"Quite a day," she sighed.

"Mm."
Three quick lines and the tiger was wearing a belt.
"Would we really have run if they'd been here for Sindy?"

Her mother sighed again.
"I don't know, petal.
Dockety would help if we did,
and Special Leaf,
but…"
She shrugged.
"All the stories they tell about Prosecutors,
and what they write in the papers,
I've never heard of anyone getting away from them."

"Maybe folks just don't write those stories,"
Maddy said.

Mama Roo smiled.
"Maybe they don't.
But speaking of Special Leaf,
you and Gumption have been spending a lot of time at his place of late."
She twitched her whiskers.
"Been, um, catching up on your reading?"

Maddy rolled her eyes.
"Mamaaa…"
She shaded in a hat for the rabbit,
pressing a little harder with the pencil than she needed to.
"It's not like that.
He just still can't do chores, is all.
And if he takes books home the other goats nettle him something fierce."
She set aside her pencil.
"Did you know that his grandma was an ox?"

"Gumption's?
I believe I did."
She sipped her tea.
"It ain't common,
different kinds getting together,
but there's nothing wrong with it.
Your papa's had some camel in it some ways back,
or so his mama told me.
Nothing wrong with that at all."

She stood,
rinsed her cup with a splash of water from the jug beside the sink,
and set it back in its place on the shelf.
Her hand lingered for a moment,
not quite touching the brown-and-blue mug that had sat and waited patiently
since Papa Roo had been kidnapped by bots.
"Don't stay up too late,"
she told Maddy.

A nudge against Maddy's ankle woke her.
She had fallen asleep at the table with her head on her arms,
a pencil still in her hand.
She yawned,
then jumped at another nudge.

"Wuzza?"
She looked under the table,
not entirely sure if she was awake or dreaming.
"Oh hey, Mouse.
You're right,
I should be in bed."

But when she stood up and turned toward the stairs
the little maintenance bot scooted in front of her.
She tried to step around it,
but it rolled back in her way again.

"Hey,
Mouse,
come on.
It's too late to play fetch,"
she grouched.

Lights flashed on the bot's back.
Its single arm pointed toward the hallway.
"What?
No,
I'm not going outside.
It's the middle of the night!"

The bot zipped back and forth a couple of times,
still pointing at the front door.
Maddy yawned again.
"Fine, I'll have a look.
But then I'm going to bed, aright?"

The dirt road outside the Roos' front door was empty
and as quiet as the stars overhead.
A chuckwill sang a two-note song somewhere in the distance,
pausing after every second note as if waiting for applause.
Maddy shivered.
The night wasn't cold,
but the air was damp and she really should be in bed.

"There, I looked, aright?"
She looked down at the little bot in exasperation.

And froze as a second bot crept out from under
the battered wicker chair that stood beside the front door.
"Hello,"
she said uncertainly.
It waggled one of its six legs at her,
then shuffled to the side to make room for another hexabot,
larger and with a heavy wrench claw in place of one of its legs.

Something clunked on the steps behind her.
She turned cautiously.
The long-legged gardening bot that some of the townspeople called the Stork
dipped its—she wasn't sure if it was a head or not,
but she nodded in reply.

Mouse nudged her ankle again,
blinked its lights,
and pointed toward the steps.
"What?
Oh no,
no no no,
not in the middle of the night."

The little bot bumped her ankle again more insistently.
"No!
Mouse,
mama would have me doing extra chores for a month if I went wandering off at this hour."
Bump.
"No!"

"Pleezz."
The buzzing voice seemed to come from all of the bots at once.
The gardening bot nudged her hand with its might-as-well-call-it-a-head.
"Pleezz."

She hesitated a moment longer,
then nodded.
"Aright.
But if anything weird happens,
I'm headin' straight back here."

The world is a different place at night.
Even the most familiar things seem new and strange by moonlight
when no one else is around.
A tree she had climbed practically every day when she was Sindy's age
looked like a silver sketch of itself.
The tall grass waving gently in the breeze by the side of the road
looked like waves on the ocean,
or at least like what she had always imagined waves looked like.

The quartet of bots led her off the road and along a narrow deerpath
to a small clearing where a dozen other bots waited patiently among the shadows.
Some she recognized from Dockety's camp,
but others were new to her.

"Hello," she said uncertainly when her guides paused.

"Hello, Miz Roo," the bots replied in unison—or no,
not in unison but in turn.
They buzzed, warbled, clicked, and hummed in rapid succession
to create the illusion of a single voice
that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.
"Thank you for coming.
It is a pleasure to meet you."

Maddy gulped.
Shaking hands didn't seem like an option,
so instead she said,
"Thank you.
Pleased to meet you too, um…?"

"We are the GearHive,"
the bots said.
"We are the little machines that no one notices,
the odds and ends that keep the world in repair.
We are many,
but we are one."

"Um, aright."
A thought struck her.
"So is Mouse always part of you?
Like,
when I'm talking to it,
am I talking to all of you too?"

"When we are many, we are many."
The bots paused.
"And when we are one, we are one."
Which Maddy thought was as clear as mud,
but the bots were still speaking.
"You helped free some parts of us
and have made others of us welcome.
We wish to thank you."

"You're welcome," she said automatically.
"It was—"

But the GearHive wasn't finished speaking.
"Your father is alive.
He is with other organic prisoners in one of Central's facilities."
The bots paused.
"We calculated that you would desire this information.
We hope we calculated correctly."

"…what?"
Maddy managed.

"We calculated that you would desire this information.
We hope we calculated correctly,"
the bots repeated.

Maddy swallowed,
her mouth suddenly dry.
Was this all actually just a dream?
"How—how do you know?
And where is he?
*How* is he?"

The stork bot clacked its shears.
The other bots twitched, wriggled, or blinked in turn
so that a wave ran through them.
"Central is holding him in one of its operational centers—the place you call Heck.
Other parts of us are captive there as well.
We can only communicate when—"
They paused.
"You do not have the words.
There are little moons above this world,
placed in the sky by the Makers.
We can only communicate with our other parts if they are in the right positions.
We receive glimpses of your father and others when they are."

Maddy shook her head.
She didn't understand the part about "little moons",
but that didn't matter.
"Is he aright?
Please,
tell me,
is he aright?"

"He is—"
The GearHive paused again as if searching for the right word.
"He is functional,
but the facility was not designed to sustain organics.
He is functional, but not optimal."

Maddy took a deep breath.
"Are you sure it's him?"

One of the hexabots scuttled forward,
pulled a scrap of paper out of the wire basket attached to its underside,
and offered it to Maddy.
She unfolded it and bit her lip.
It was a sketch of her and her sister—just their faces,
but she'd recognize her father's wide-eyed style anywhere.

She steadied herself.
"Can you get him out?
Can you—can you bring him home?"

The lights on Mouse's back blinked.
"Not without help," the GearHive said.
"We are many, but we are small.
We need help.
We need your sister's help."

"What? No!"
Maddy shook her head.
"Sindy's just a kid.
She's not going anywhere near Heck!"

The GearHive's component bots rustled.
"We are many, but we are small," they repeated.
"Even together, when we are larger, we are not organic.
There are machines in the facility that only work for organic operators.
This is why Central takes your people.
This is why we need your sister."
The stork bot clacked its shears again for emphasis.

"But—"
*But she almost didn't make it back the last time,*
Maddy thought.
*And neither did I, and Gumption could have died.*

She took another deep breath,
held it,
and let it out slowly
as she squeezed her hands into fists and relaxed them.
Special Leaf had taught her to do that.
*Slow your body, quicken your mind.*

A sudden thought struck her.
"What about the Prosecutors?" she asked excitedly.
"They're organic,
and they know *tons* more about sneaking into places and fighting bots and what-not than anyone!
And they're right here—they came in this morning.
I can bring 'em out here to meet you and—"

"No!"
The GearHive's voice was stern.
"Not them.
Not anyone,
but especially not them.
They hunt our kind.
They disconnect us.
They disassemble us.
They *destroy* us.
You must not tell them we are here."
Mouse rolled back and forth in agitation,
its lights blinking a rapid frightened pattern.

Maddy swallowed,
suddenly aware that it was the middle of the night
and no one knew where she was.
She shivered as the breeze ruffled her fur.
"I gotta think about this," she hedged.
"If I want to talk to you again,
do I just ask Mouse?"

There was a moment of silence.
"What is 'mouse'?" the GearHive asked suspiciously.

Maddy pointed at the little cleaning bot.
"That one.
I didn't know its real name, so I called it Mouse."

The stork bot clacked its shears.
"Its designation is Beta-Loopy Nine Six Six Four Rev Two,"
the GearHive said.
Mouse blinked.
"But it says you may continue to call it Mouse."
Mouse blinked again.
"And it has something for you."

Mouse rolled foward and reached up with its single arm
to hand Maddy a—a something.
She turned it over in her hand.
It was as long as her thumb but twice as thick,
made of dark glass and metal.
Some parts were fused smoothly together,
others looked like they had been welded on as afterthoughts,
and the button on the end was protected by a cover plate.
"What is it?"

"It is a discombobulator," the GearHive said.

Maddy gave the stork bot a look.
"Seriously?
That's just a thing in kids' stories."
Which she still read, she didn't add.

"Very well.
It is a triphasic ee-em remodulator with enhanced wide-band refulgence."

Maddy digested that.
"So what does it discombobulate?"

"It will hide you from Central, but only for a brief time.
It should work four or five—"
One of the hexabots wriggled its forelegs out of sync with the other bots.
"Two or three times,"
the GearHive amended.
"After that,
Central will learn the pattern and it will no longer be effective."

Maddy hefted it,
then slid it into a pocket in her dress.
"Aright.
I still got to think about it."

"Think quickly,"
the GearHive warned.
"Central moves its prisoners from station to station.
Your father is on the outskirts of Heck now,
but only for a while.
If he is relocated,
we may not be able to reach him."

Maddy nodded.
"Come on," she said to Mouse.
"I'll walk you home."

## A Little Bit of Luck

Gumption turned the discombobulator over in his hands.
"It's a lot heavier than it looks."

Maddy put her hands on her hips.
"Gumption Goat!
Is that all you can think to say?
It's heavier than it looks?"

"Well, what do you want me to say?" he replied defensively,
handing the tech back to her.
"You're the one havin' midnight conversations with strange bots,
and you want *my* opinion?"
He sighed,
already wishing that he hadn't snapped at her.

Maddy had been waiting for him that morning when he left home to do his chores.
That wasn't unusual—Gumption's dad hadn't even bothered to wink at him
when they rounded the corner to find Maddy standing next to a sheltering pine—but
he had known right away that something was wrong.

The story of the previous night's meeting had spilled out of her
like stew being poured out of a saucepan.
At first Gumption had tried asking questions,
but each time she doubled back he just got more confused.
The tech she handed him made it all very real,
though—real enough to make his ribs twinge.

"So what are you going to do?"
he asked.

"I don't know," she said.
She blinked and wiped her face with her sleeve.
"I don't *know*, Gumption.
I have to go after my dad,
you know I do,
but I can't—"
She halted.

"You can't take Sindy with you,
because if anything happened to her it would break you mama's heart,"
Gumption finished for her.
She nodded.

Gumption swallowed hard and took her hand in his.
"Well, whatever you decide to do, I'm in."
He squeezed her hand for emphasis.

"How can you say that?"
Maddy wailed.
"I don't even know yet if I'm going to do anything!"

Gumption squeezed her hand again before letting go of it.
He really, *really* hoped she couldn't hear his heart pounding.
"Of course you are.
And whatever it is, I—you know,
if I can help or anything,
I will."

Maddy sniffled, then forced a weak smile.
"You're just sayin' that 'cause you hope you'll get your ribs broke again
and get to skip some more chores."

"Absolutely," Gumption nodded.
"But speakin' of chores,
we best get started on ours or we're gonna have bigger problems than crazy bots."

"What do you mean, crazy bots?"
Gumption and Maddy jumped as Sindy stepped out from behind a nearby tree.

"Sindy!
What do you mean by sneaking up on people like that?"
Maddy scolded.

"I wasn't sneaking," Sindy protested.
"I was just walking home and I heard you and—"

"—and decided to sneak up on us and do a bit of eavesdropping,"
Maddy finished sternly.
"Anyway, why aren't you at Shaper Leaf's?
Don't you have a lesson?"

"Shaper Leaf isn't feeling well again.
For real!"
she added as Maddy opened her mouth.
"He was looking *real* tired."

"Well,
if you don't have a lesson with him,
you ought to be in school with us.
No,
no,
none of that!"
Maddy continued in a tone that reminded Gumption uncomfortably of Mama Roo.
"Now come along, both of you.
It isn't polite to be late."

"Sorry, Miz Winnie,"
the trio said in unison a few minutes later.
They had gotten to school
just as Rusty Bridge's other children were finishing
a ragged rendition of the Plea to the Makers.
The teacher,
a horse with a graying mane that she dyed and a matching sock on one leg that she didn't,
scolded them more sternly than usual
as they slipped into their usual seats.

The reason quickly became apparent.
"Class,
we have a special treat today.
How many of you know what a Prosecutor is?"
Every hand shot into the air.
"And how many of you know that
we actually have some Prosecutors here in Rusty Bridge *right now*?"
Hands strained to reach even higher,
and an excited murmur rippled through the room.

"Well,"
Miz Winnie said indulgently,
"If you all promise to be *very good*,
we have a special treat today.
Everybody find a partner.
No,
Jessamyn,
you can't be your own partner,
just—yes, anyone will do.
All right?
Two by two,
then,
let's go outside for our surprise!"
And then she sighed as twenty-two children scrambled for the door,
their partners forgotten.

Gumption was the last one through the door.
"Oh wow," he breathed,
then added,
"Sorry,"
when Maddy shot him a look.
There,
in the center of the more-or-less rectangular playing field behind the school,
stood Special Blazes and bear who had arrived with him.
Both of them were wearing their uniform trousers,
but instead of their jackets they had plain tunics
no different from what Rusty Bridge's farm hands would wear to do a warm day's work.

"Get outta-come on, I wanna see."
Bluster and Bravo shouldered their way through the other children
to stand front and center.

"I missed you in class today,"
Miz Winnie said curtly.

"Doin' chores,"
Bluster lied without looking at her.
He elbowed his twin.
"Look at the size of 'em!"

The tiger's ear twitched.
Without warning he crouched and roared.
Everyone jumped,
and a few of the smaller children squeaked.

Special Blazes straightened and bared his teeth
in what Gumption really hoped was a smile.
"Good morning.
Who can tell me what we just learned?"

"That you're really scary!"
Bluster called,
scowling when Bravo made a kissing sound beside him.

"I try,"
Special Blazes said modestly.
"But the real lesson is surprise.
If you're ever in trouble—if you're ever attacked
by bots or anyone else—try to surprise them.
Do something unexpected.
Like this!"

He scooped up a wooden baton from the grass by his feet
and swung it at his companion's head.
*Swish swish!*
Gumption heard the baton cut the air,
but as fast as it was,
the bear was faster.
She twisted sideways to avoid the first blow,
ducked to avoid the second,
then threw a punch that would have knocked the tiger halfway across the field
if it had landed.

But it didn't.
The tiger spun the baton around to knock the punch aside,
then stepped in close and brought their hand up to the bear's throat.
"Aaaand you're dead," he said pleasantly.

Some of the children clapped.
Special Blazes handed the bear the baton and clapped her on the shoulder.
"Come now,"
he said,
"You can do better than that for my friend Meribeth,
can't you?"

Gumption joined the applause,
but stopped at a sour look from Maddy.
"So here's the second lesson,"
the tiger said.
"Training wins.
Training beats size and speed and everything else you can think of."

"What about tech?"
Bluster asked.

"Even tech,"
Meribeth the bear rasped.
Her voice was as rough as sandpaper scraping rust off an old can.
She took the baton from Special Blazes,
spun it around,
and settled into fighting stance.

The tiger stepped back,
raised his fists,
and winked at the children as his fists burst into flame.
The flurry of punches, kicks, and whirlwind baton strikes that followed
was too fast for Gumption to follow.
Special Blazes threw one fireball after another.
The bear batted them aside,
somehow finding time to strike at her opponent in between.

And then Meribeth threw the baton at Special Blazes' head.
As he ducked,
she reached forward and grabbed the front of his shirt.
"Gotcha," she growled as her other hand closed around his throat.

Nobody had to prompt the children to applaud this time.
"Woo hoo!" Bluster whooped.
"That was *amazing*!"

Miz Winnie stepped forward.
"All right, um, thank you,
thank you very much for, um, for that demonstration" she said.
"Now how about we all line up and go *back into the classroom*
and we can ask the Prosecutors about
all the *other* things they know how to do?"

Gumption and Maddy found themselves in line behind the goat twins.
"We *got* got be Prosecutors," Bluster told his twin excitedly.
"Did you see how they—blam! blam!"
He threw a couple of punches at the air.

"It was all right,"
Bravo allowed.

"I bet they rehearsed the whole thing,"
Maddy muttered.

"Better than makin' stupid little pictures,"
Bluster shot back.
Gumption put his hand on Maddy's arm and squeezed to stop her from replying.

The children settled into their seats.
Special Blazes stood at the front of the class
with his hands clasped behind his back
as Miz Winnie counted to make sure no one was missing.
Gumption looked back at the door,
but Meribeth had disappeared.

"Now, who has questions?" Miz Winnie said.
Hands shot into the air.
How old had Special Blazes been when he became a Prosecutor?
Eighteen, but he'd joined a troop of Junior Prosecutors when he was twelve.
Oh, really?
There wasn't one in Rusty Bridge?
Well, they'd have to fix that wouldn't they.

Could they see his tech?
Special Blazes looked at Miz Winnie and tapped his chest.
When she nodded,
pulled up his shirt.
The children ooh'ed and aah'ed at the glassy diamond lozenge strapped to his chest.
"It lets me make fireballs with my feet too," he said as he pulled down his shirt,
"But they're a lot harder to aim,
and pretty hard on my boots."

Had he ever killed anyone?
"Bluster!"
Miz Winnie scolded.

"No, no, it's a fair question," Special Blazes said.
"And unfortunately, the answer is 'yes'.
I never set out to,
but sometimes…"
He shrugged, his face solemn.
"Sometimes you have to choose between one life and many."

"What about bots?"
Maddy asked loudly.

The corner of the tiger's mouth quirked.
"Miz Roo, I presume?
Pleased to make your acquaintance."

"Pleased to meet you as well,"
Maddy said in a voice that could have made ice cubes.
"So if you don't mind me asking,
how many bots have you killed?"

"Too many," the Prosecutor replied levelly.
"And I hope I've never *decommissioned* any that I didn't have to.
But you of all people should know how dangerous rogue bots can be.
Our job is to keep the living safe.
Any bot that respects that has nothing to fear from me or any other Prosecutor."
