- at the start of the story, they think Santa Claws is a myth

- the elves steal the fairies' toys and copy them to give to humans
  - the reason human toys aren't as good as they used to be is that the elves haven't come raiding in a while
- the ship only contains dinosaurs - no-one more recent
  - the elves are copies of dinosaur children
  - Ike opted not to be copied - he wants to be a jet for real

The rev I sent yesterday has too much plot for the lengt of the story (and the attention span of its intended audience).  Here's something simpler:

- the dinosaurs built Santa Claws 65 million years ago to entertain their children
- then they discovered the asteroid was coming and decided to go and explore the galaxy
- left Santa Claws behind ("a childish thing")
- Santa Claws was lonely
  - was very happy when dolphins evolved
    - they could tell each other stories and say "thank you"
    - but they didn't actually *need* much
  - was even happier when primates started making tools
    - "You can always give someone a rock"
- powered down to sleep through the last ice age
- woke up to find that cats were training humans how to open doors
  - Madica: "but if there weren't humans, there wouldn't be any doors to open"
  - cat: "That's right - cats believe every problem contains its own solution and vice versa"
- Santa Claws was jealous of the attention that cats were getting
  - makes a sarcastic remark about cats inventing the Internet to send each other pictures of themselves
  - ninja cat replies, "We let the humans do the sending, of course"
- then Santa Claws got a signal saying that the dinosaurs were coming home for a visit in a few thousand years
  - doesn't want the dinosaurs to know she's been making gifts for mammals (embarrassing)
  - so nudged an asteroid to hit the earth
  - "it's a shame about the humans, but I won't miss the cats"
- snarkasaurus was on the mission to nudge the asteroid
  - discovered that Santa Claws is plotting to replace all the current ELFs with newly-ELFed fairies
    - wipe the slate clean so that no one will know they've been making toys for mammals
  - other ELFs sent to retrieve her
- Mr Poudell is Santa Claws' partner in conspiracy
  - he teaches Human Studies, which for him is mostly horror stories about how awful humans are
    - "Look at what they do to each other... Look at what they've done to this world"
  - he's going to help Santa Claws ELF the fairies
    - "at least we'll survive"
  - show him as nervous before the big saucer arrives in the fairy city
    - the giant metal T. rex is Santa's original body, which is being cleaned and refurbished
- Ike and Laurellen were picked up accidentally when the knapsack with the snarkasaurus was grabbed
  - Santa is using them as guinea pigs for fairy ELFing
  - Ike was enthusiastic (hint at his inner life) so he was ELFed first
- now need to steal the big saucer because the asteroid is now too close for the small ones to push it out of the way
  - the ship's crew are all ELFs who are being punished for wanting their original bodies back
    - Santa Claws experimented over the ages with many different creatures before humans evolved
    - so the ELFs in the castle aren't lost children (Sadie thinks that's too scary)
    - they're survivors of extinct species
  - their brains are put in boxes to run the ship, and headless robot copies of their original bodies are used for mechanical tasks
- finale
  - Madica accidentally fires up a big video screen and Mr Poudell answers - that's when she realizes he's in on the plot
  - Santa Claws docks with the big saucer wearing a small body (and a red suit)
    - goal is to nudge the asteroid back onto collision course
    - cat comments that this is his "delivering presents" body, and it's really fast
  - chase, battle, the ninja cat's sacrifice
  - end with them heading back to Earth
    - ELFs to free, a very naughty Mr Poudell to speak to
    - "We'll need to talk to the humans to get them ready for the dinosaurs" (Laurellen)
    - the best Christmas ever

Other notes:

- mostly a simple adventure story, but Madica realizes that other people have their stories too
  - need to show her as unconsciously self-centered at the start
  - realizes with a shock that Laurellen and Ike have feelings and their own internal dramas

- when cats are "sleeping" they're really rehearsing their ninja moves in their heads
  - they have very good imaginations
  - have the cat take a nap as soon as they get to the saucer (or something like that)

- fairies lose their wings when they hit puberty
  - "young enough to still have tiny little wings"
