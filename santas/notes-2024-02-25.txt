The beginning is strong. I enjoyed. I like the jumps between worlds with different santas. 

I have problem with the Dino that started everything and the evolution of the Santas in the different universes. Also how he create the elves and the role he assign to them. Then he went to sleep. If only the elves were awake how the other Santa’s appeared? And why they are called Santa’s ?

I like the struggle of the protagonist on their identity and also the meta struggles on what is what Santas and elves do together and the classes fight and the importance of roles for a same goal.  

Here are something missing explaining better this two (?) sides of the history. The one that want to gift everything to everyone the full year with the elves doing everything and the one that want to keep once a year only to the good kids and with the traditional roles of elves and Santas.

Perhaps the outcomes of the two ideologies coming together is our reality: everyone is Santa (parents, grandparents, uncles, teachers) and most of child that believes get something. The entire world agree on a beautiful lie once a year, and when you grow then your elders told you the truth and you join the force of “Santas and eleves”, to maintain the illusion alive for the children. Because a little magic made everything more easy, even if you know is not magic. 

I like that chimneys can be other thing that a chimneys. 

And I still can’t imagine what the elephants has to do in all this.
