## A Warning

*You probably think this is a Christmas story because of the santas,
but it's not.
It's about right and wrong and revolution,
about true love and the other kinds,
and about how by the time you go home it isn't really home any more.*

*There's one kiss and several explosions.
The footnotes are there to lighten things up,
but if you need a someone to hold your hand during the scary bits
tough—I'm just a book, and we don't have hands.*

## Episode 1: In Which We Meet Our Protagonist

Once upon a time,
in a world halfway between yours and mine,
lived a young santa named Finner.
He came from a long line of santas:
his mother boxed and wrapped her first wind-up singing wombat
when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself,
while his father started helping with deliveries
as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.<span class="sidenote">
There's a story behind the word "reliably" in that sentence,
but it's best told some other time.
</span>

Finner enjoyed santafying—at least, he tried to.
After all,
who *wouldn't* enjoy slithering down a sooty chimney
or trying to land a sleigh on a yurt without leaving a single dent in its stiff felt roof?
But no matter what he did,
a small voice in Finner's head said, "Me.
I don't enjoy this.
Or rather, I do, but it's not enough."

What he *did* enjoy,
at least for a while,
was going into the basement and helping the family's elves.
The smell of solder,
the *shick shick* of freshly-sharpened scissors,
the feeling of the two halves of a dovetail joint fitting perfectly together—they
felt right in a way that clambering up the icy concrete side of an apartment building
never did.

His parents tolerated it at first.
"Good for him to know how things are made,"
they told each other.
After a while, though,
they began hinting that maybe he should being ho-ho-ho'ing in the attic
rather than sewing or gluing.
And a while after that,
Finner could tell that the hints were about to become
a number six talk from his father,<span class="sidenote">Direct eye contact,
patient but serious voice,
lots of awkward pauses on both sides,
every third sentence starting, "Your mother and I think…"</span>
so he put the tools he had borrowed from the elves back in their boxes
and pretended he couldn't hear their hammering any longer.

And so Finner became more restless every day.
His mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over
to burn off the energy:
it only made him sweaty.
He tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes closed
while he hummed softly to himself like the monks of Lotse Nuffin:<span class="sidenote">
The monks were his father's favorite clients.
They wanted nothing,
so every year that's exactly what he took them,
and they were always grateful.
</span>
all he got was a cold bum.

He tried to talk to his friends about it
without actually explaining the problem.
That didn't go well.
Finner's parents were the only santas in town.
There were others nearby—aunts and uncles
and second cousins twice removed
and even a few who'd married into the trade
and done quite well for themselves
despite what Finner's great-grandmother never actually said out loud at family gatherings.<span class="sidenote">
She was a hundred and twenty two years old,
and could not say things so loudly that no one else could hear themselves think.</span>
BUt none of children Finner went to school with or played Hide and Stay Hidden with
could ever really understand how much hard work went into making that one day special every year.

That thought made him wonder if he was lazy,
which was a synonym for "sinful" where he lived,
so he tried a few experiments.
Working twice as hard made him even sweatier than running up and down stairs.
Working half as hard made his father ask if he was sick and his mother mutter about teenagers.
Neither made the yearning in his chest for *something* go away.
It grew and grew until finally,
desperately,
he realized there was only one thing left for him to do.
He would have to ask his great-grandmother for advice.

Gran-Granna Tumbly spent most of her time napping,
but she had been one of the greatest santas ever.
She had once delivered a chocolate orange cake to a trio of scientists in a submarine
*without using a submarine herself*,
and then delivered a baby on the way home.<span class="sidenote">
"Delivered" in the conventional sense of helping someone give birth
rather than the postal sense used for packages.
Elves did make dolls sometimes that were so lifelike normal people though they were real,
and (whisper it) sometimes santas would deliver them in the dead of night when most people were sleeping
and take a real child in exchange,
but we're not at that part of the story yet.
</span>
Everyone was a little bit afraid of her,
except for the unfortunate few who had felt the full force of her disapproving glare:
they were a *lot* afraid.
But if you had a problem—a *real* problem,
not just a lost sock or a broken heart<span class="sidenote">Gran-Granna Tumbly
did once make an exception for someone whose heart was broken
because they had lost a very special sock
and there was a very real chance of the world ending as a result,
but that story is also best told some other time.</span>—you could
always knock on her door.

Finner waited until Tuesday afternoon before going to see her.
The postman delivered<span class="sidenote">In the postal sense of the word.</span>
her weekly order of chocolate on Tuesday just before lunch,
and Finner hoped that would put her in a good mood.
"Or at least a less grumpy one," he thought
as he trudged through the damp, clumpy snow that had fallen overnight.
The last time he had seen her had been the family gathering at Long Night the year before.
Finner's uncle had accidentally served Gran-Granna a cup of camomile tea,
and had squirmed for an hour as she drank it one slow, withering sip at a time.

The Tumbly house looked exactly like those on either side of it:
a front door with an evergreen wreath on it,
a large curtained window to one side,
and a pair of smaller windows with matching curtains on the floor above.
The downstairs window had a warm, welcoming glow,
and even from the street Finner could smell curry and freshly-baked bread.
The only remarkable thing was a statue of a cat sitting on an round pedestal
in the middle of the front yard,
its stone eyes fixed on a snow-filled bird bath.<span class="sidenote">The houses on either side
had a miniature Ferris wheel
and a model locomotive in their front yards,
though,
so to be fair,
the statue wasn't *that* remarkable.</span>

Finner took a deep breath, walked up to the door, and knocked.
When nothing happened he knocked again.
"Well that was a bust," he said aloud,
secretly relieved.

"She just nipped out to get some broccoli," a voice rumbled behind him.
"If you don't mind waiting a moment…?"

Finner turned around slowly.
The stone cat had turned its head toward him,
but was clearly still keeping one eye on the empty bird bath.
"I—sure," he said lamely,
then added, "Thank you,"
because a stone statue of a cat is still in some sense a cat,
and one of the first lessons a santa is taught is
to always be polite to cats.<span class="sidenote">And watchmakers,
but that's also—you know what?
If it really is a story for another time,
then from now on we'll just not mention it.</span>

"Of course," the cat rumbled.
It turned its head back toward the bird bath,
and together they waited in silence.

They didn't have to wait long.
A tricycle taxi rolled up in front of the house and wheezed to a gentle stop.
The taxi pedaller climbed out of his seat,
stretched until his spine went *pop!*,
nodded at Finner (or possibly the cat),
and then opened the cab door and helped Gran-Granna Tumbly down.
Pocketing the half-coins she handed him,
he climbed back onto his seat and pedalled away.

Finner belatedly remembered that he was an able-bodied youth
and Gran-Granna was neither.
"Can I carry that for you?" he asked,
hurrying back down the short walk to the gate.

Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at the broccoli in her hand and snorted.
"I think I can manage, thank you," she said.
"Did you catch anything?"

"Uh…" Finner started, confused.

"No," the cat statue rumbled.
"But I remain hopeful."

"Hmph."
Finner stepped out of the way as Gran-Granna Tumbly walked briskly up the path,
the tip of her cane stabbing through the snow on every second step.
"Well, since you're here, you might as well come in."

"Yes'm," Finner said obediently.
With one last glance at the motionless cat he followed her through the door
and into the rest of his life.

## Episode 2: In Which a Door Opens

Finner had never actually been in Gran-Granna's house before,
but he'd heard stories.
A richly-patterned carpet in the hall that looked like it might once have been able to fly: check.
A set of coathooks with gargoyle faces: check.<span class="sidenote">Which were actually just
pieces of wood carved to look like gargoyle faces.
It wouldn't be necessary to clarify this for most people.</span>
A sitting room filled with a riot of greenery and a mis-matched pair of overstuffed chairs: check.
Crossed harpoons over the fireplace and dozens of framed pictures
of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, neighbors, friends, enemies<span class="sidenote">Some of which
had dates and locations written on them in neat, smug lettering.</span>,
and the grateful, if somewhat perplexed, crew of a submarine: check.

And there was a teapot—*the* teapot,
the one people spoke about in hushed voices.
It didn't look special,
but it was never empty and its contents were never cold.
Bitter, sometimes,
if that's what guests needed,
but never cold.

Finner waited for Gran-Granna to settle into a chair
before seating himself nervously on the edge of the other one.
She spooned a bit of sugar into a green-and-white teacup,
glanced at him,
added a bit more,
and then poured slowly and carefully.
"You'll want to let that cool down a bit," she advised,
filling the second cup for herself
and sitting back with it cradled in her hands.

"Thank you,"
Finner said,
not knowing what else to say.
What *was* he going to say?
"Nothing feels right," was awfully vague,
and, "What should I do with my life?" seemed awfully—

"The thing about being old," Gran-Granna said without any preamble,
"Is that people think it makes you wise."

The silence that followed was broken only by
the ticking of the burl clock in the kitchen.
"Doesn't it?" Finner asked,
because it felt like the kind of statement
that wanted to be invited to take off its coat and sit for a while.

"Not so far as I can tell,"
Gran-Granna sighed.
She sipped her tea,
eyes half-closed like a cat having its ears scratched.
"But it does give you a passel of stories to tell.
Take your Auncle Minglin, for example."
She gestured at a picture on the wall of someone Finner vaguely remembered
having spilled cranberry juice on a white tablecloth at some point.
"Kind heart,
and a beautiful singing voice,
but as clumsy as an ox on ice skates.
They could trip over a rock that was clear across the other side of the street."

"So no deliveries?"
Finner ventured.

"That's certainly the conclusion they reached.
And they were pretty down in the mouth about it,
let me tell you.
The world needs doctors and zeppelin pilots and what-not,
but when when you've been told your whole life that you're destined for something else,
well,
it's hard to change direction."

Finner turned his teacup around in his hands.
"So what happened to them?"

Gran-Granna smiled.
"They ran off and joined the opera.
Last I heard,
they were singing six shows a week with not an empty seat in the house."
She sipped her tea.
"The way I look at it,
they *did* become a santa.
They're giving people the gift of music night after night
and that's no small thing."

She sighed.
"But they don't see it that way,
and I don't know if they ever will.
Doesn't matter how hard people applaud
or how many times they're called back for encores—deep in their heart,
they'll always think of themself as 'not at santa'."

"Which brings us to you," she continued,
bright eyes fixed on Finner,
who at that moment desperately regretted having come to see her
and wished he could be almost anywhere else in the world.<span class="sidenote">"Almost",
because he had taken geography in school and knew about volcanoes.</span>

"M-me?" Finner stammered.

"Yes, y-you," Gran-Granna said impatiently.
"Your folks have been worried about you for a while now.
Oh, I know, you didn't think anyone had noticed,
but you've been mopey and anxious
and all the other things young people get carried away with these days,
only more so."

A clock chimed quietly in the kitchen next door.
Somewhere in the distance,
someone called for their children to come inside,
it was time for bed and their teeth weren't going to brush themselves.
"I just don't know what to do," Finner confessed,
angry at the tears that he was absolutely *not* going to cry.
"I like the ho-ho-ho'ing,
but deliveries are—"
He paused for breath.
"It's like everyone else is excited about it but I'm just watching myself do it,
you know?
Like this is someone else's life and I've just put it on like a sweater
except it doesn't quite fit
and no matter how many times I wash it,
it'll still smell a bit like whoever it really belongs to."

"Hmph,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly snorted.
"Fancy words like that,
maybe you ought to think about becoming a writer."

"Maybe," Finner mumbled.<span class="sidenote">He'd written stories and poems for school.
Doing it made volcanoes seem attractive.</span>

*THUMP!* He jumped as something heavy hit the floor in the room overhead.
"What was that?"

Gran-Granna picked up her cane and struggled to her feet.
"Never you mind," she said curtly.
"It's late and your folks will be wondering where you are.
You best be—"

*THUMP!* "Ow, get off me!" a female voice said peevishly.

Finner reached for his great-grandmother.
"I think someone's up there," he whispered loudly.

Gran-Granna rolled her eyes.
"Door," she said, pointing at it with her cane.
"You. Through it. Now."

"Vidancia! Vidancia, where are you?"
a second voice bellowed from above.

"Quiet!" the first voice said.

"Vidanci-ulp!"
Finner practically heard someone putting their hand over someone else's mouth.

He gestured weakly toward the front door.
"I should—" he started.

Heavy boots thumped on carpeted steps
as the biggest, beardiest santa Finner had ever seen came downstairs
and wrapped his arms around Gran-Granna Tumbly in a number three hug.<span class="sidenote">Both arms,
full wrap,
strong squeeze for two or three heartbeats depending on how bad things are.</span>
To Finner's complete surprise the santa started crying.

"Oh Vidancia," he blubbered.
"It's awful.
It's *awful*."

Gran-Granna Tumbly wriggled out of the beard and the hug.
"Let me guess—did your llamas eat your favorite hat again?"

"The llamas are gone,"
said a second santa
who had come silently down the stairs behind the first one.
She was no taller than Finner,
but lean where the first santa was brawny,
and her uniform—Finner did a double take.
Her hood and sack were red and white,
but the rest was changing color to match the carpet on the stairs.
And—was that an ax strapped to the first santa's back?
A really big ax that looked like it was designed for chopping off heads
rather than for turning logs into kindling?

"What do you mean 'gone'?" Gran-Granna demanded,
pulling a handkerchief out of her sleeve and handing it to the big santa
in a way that clearly meant,
"Stop sniffling and get ahold of yourself."

"I mean they are gone.
No longer in their proper surroundings.
Ex-located.
Completely, utterly, elsewhere."
The second santa sat down heavily on the stairs.

"You're hurt," Gran-Granna said accusingly.

The second santa waved her off.
"It's nothing.
Just some broken ribs.
And maybe an eardrum.
One of my presents went off a little early," she added,
sounding just a little bit proud.

The burly santa wiped his eyes on a sleeve that Finner could have used as a sleeping bag.
"The elves were helpin' me load up the stagecoach for the weekly delivery,
just like they always do,
an' then blam!"
He smacked a meaty fist into an equally meaty palm.
"There they were,
all over us.
I tried to fight 'em off, Vidancia, I swear."
His lower lip trembled.

"I know you did," Gran-Granna said gently.
"What about your elves?"

"Out through the chimney, somewhere safe."
The second santa shifted and winced.
"At least,
as safe as anyone right now."

She turned her gaze on Finner.
Something very much like a mild electric shock ran down his spine
as her dark eyes locked with his.
"And who's this?" she asked.

Before anyone could answer there was another pair of *thumps* upstairs.
"Well," a somewhat disappointed voice said a moment later.
"It's not exactly a palace, is it?"

The burly santa growled and reached for his ax.
The one on the stairs struggled to her feet.
"They're here," she spat.

"So it appears,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly said grimly.
She twisted the head of her cane
and to Finner's absolute dumbfoundment<span class="sidenote">Yes, that really is a word.</span>
drew a slender silver rapier.
"Hold this," she ordered,
handing the remaining cane-y bit of the cane to Finner,
and then everything went a little bit nuts.

## Episode 3: In Which a Moderate Amount of Mayhem Occurs

The second santa pulled a grenade out of her sack,
drew the pin with her teeth,
and chucked it overhand up the stairs.
"Bang," she said calmly.
Sure enough,
a second later there was a loud, sharp *crack!*
Bilious green foam began expanding into the stairs.

"That won't hold them for long,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly said,
twisting at the waist until her spine made a noise
that put the grenade's to shame.

"We can take 'em!" the big santa bellowed,
hefting his totally intimidating ax,
which was in fact larger than Finner.

"No we can't," Gran-Granna snapped.
A UPF<span class="sidenote">Unidentified Piece of Furniture. It's like a flying saucer,
except it's rectangular (usually),
doesn't fly (unless it's thrown very hard),
and (probably) isn't of alien origin.</span> crashed through a window upstairs
and landed in the front yard with a wet *thud*.
Boots clattered on the porch roof.

"That window *does* open," Gran-Granna Tumbly muttered.
Sparkles ran down the rapier in her hand.

"Is that a *magic* sword?" Finner breathed.

"Not magic enough," their great-grandmother snapped.
"You two! Chimney! Now! And you."
She pointed at Finner.
"You go with them and you do exactly what they say, understand?"

"Go where?" Finner didn't have a chance to ask,
because at precisely that moment something roared in the front yard.
It was the kind of sound that bypasses the ears
and goes directly to the bit in the back of the brain
that evolved to keep a million generations of ancestors
out of the stomachs of large predators.

"What—" someone in the front yard started to say but never managed to finish.
Someone else simply screamed, briefly.
There was a moment of stunned silence,
and then the shooting started.

The burly santa yanked Finner under the shelter of his enormous ax.
Bullets ricocheted off it to make lethal little holes in the pictures on the walls.
The other santa dove across the room to take shelter beside Finner.
Punctured in a dozen places,
the green foam in the stairs made a wet, farty noise
and began to deflate.

"Get to the chimney!" Gran-Granna Tumbly shouted.
Her sword flashed back and forth,
knocking bullets away from them.<span class="sidenote">Or possibly from her teapot.
Finner wondered about that later…</span>

The big santa picked him up like a sack of laundry
and took two enormous strides across the room
and something *twisted*,
Finner didn't see exactly what or how,
but suddenly Gran-Granna's fireplace was gone,
or rather it was still there but it was also a doorway,
like one of those puzzle pictures that looks like two different things at once,
and then everything stretched around them
or possibly they did the stretching
and they were somewhere else.

It was bright.
In fact,
it was daytime,
when a moment ago it had been dark and evening.
And there was sand—lots of sand.
And—

"That looks like a pyramid,"
a small part of Finner's brain<span class="sidenote">Not the part that evolved
to keep him out of predators—pyramids weren't really its concern.</span> told the rest of him.

The second santa got to her feet and brushed sand off her uniform,
which had already started to turn a dusty beige.
"Where are we?" she asked.

It took Finner a moment to realize she was asking him.
"I don't know."
It was hot, he realized.
Much too hot for the winter coat he was wearing.
And where was Gran-Granna?

The santa stared at him.
Her eyes widened.
"He doesn't know," she said to the big santa.

"Don't know what?" Finner was about to ask,
but before he could,
a voice behind him moaned,
"Greeeetinnngs…"

He spun around and found himself face-to-face with—he wasn't quite sure what.
It was tall and withered
and wrapped in tattered bandages
made from the rags of what might once have been a santa's uniform.
Its eyes didn't quite line up,
and—was that a *bone* of the end of one of its arms
where there really ought to be a hand?<span class="sidenote">Even a mechanical hand would have been okay.
Finner had an aunt who had started wearing one
after an unfortunate encounter with a particularly nasty guard goose,
and more than a few careless elves had needed mechanical upgrades
after what people referred to as "workshop incidents".</span>

The burly santa hefted his ax.
"Friend or foe?" he demanded.

The mummy santa smiled, or more accurately bared its large, yellow teeth.
"That depends on…
whether you brought…
tea.
And treats…
for my pets."
At the word "treats",
one of the giant cat statues at the base of the pyramid
turned its head and blinked,
which made the "stay out of predators" part of Finner's brain go, "Ding ding ding!"

"Tea?" the burly santa asked,
clearly never having had this particular response to his friend-or-foe question before.

"She always…
brings tea.
And treats.
And sometimes…
a magazine?"
the mummy santa finished hopefully.

"No magazines, I'm afraid, and no tea either,"
the lean santa said,
her uniform a perfect match for the sand around them.
"We had to leave Sensei Tumbly's in rather a hurry."

"Ssss…"
The mummy hissed with disappointment.
"I suppose…
you're going…
to claim…
refuge?"

The lean santa elbowed her burly companion's ribs to stop him from speaking.
"As is our right," she said.
"A cookie, a glass of milk, and the use of your chimney."

"Heh.
Heh.
Heh."
The mummy said the words one by one with somewhat unsettling pauses between them.
"No milk…
or cookies…
here.
Not for…
a long…
time."
The giant stone cat behind it stepped down from its pedestal.
Finner gulped as three more joined it.
Some seemed to be missing minor parts like ears or tails,
but that didn't do anything to quiet the "ding ding ding!" in his brain.

The lean santa reached into her sack.
For a heartbeat Finner thought she was going to throw another foam grenade,
but instead she pulled out a mask.
Blue with silver pinstripes that sparkled in the light,
it sparkled slightly in her hand when she held it up.

The mummy hissed again.
"You bring…
*that*…
here!?"
The cats around it growled.

The santa stuffed the mask back into her sack.
"They came out of nowhere.
We had people watching the chimney night and day,
and I swear,
they didn't come through that way."
She glanced at the santa with the ax.
"They took his llamas."

"And smashed my carriage,"
the big santa added.
"But I got my elves away safe."

The lean santa shrugged.
"Safe for now, maybe.
I'm just so tired of running."
She was exhausted, Finner realized, exhausted and very, very frightened
but trying hard not to show it.

The mummy hissed sympathetically.
"I know…
how…
you feel…
child."
It looked past her at the dry sand surrounding them.
"This was…
green…
once…
But that…
was long ago…"

One of the stone cats yowled softly.
The mummy straightened.
"Yes…
I will…
grant you…
refuge.
Follow…
me."

It turned toward the pyramid,
then hesitated.
"And…
please…
don't mind…
the mess.
I'm…
redecorating."

As they climbed the worn stone steps on the pyramid
Finner sidled over to the lean santa.
"Can you please tell me what's going on?"

She sighed.
"The usual, I'm afraid.
We're trying to save the worlds."

## Episode 4: In Which Some Introductions are Made

Zombies and mummies are similar in many ways—the shambling gait,
the moaning,
and of course the whole "undead" thing—but
there are important differences.
First,
mummies are generally royalty,
or the servants of royalty,
while zombies tend to have been idiots who went into the basement after dark
despite the strange sounds they heard
or didn't run fast enough when someone shouted,
"Look out, they're coming!"
Second,
mummies are created through a complex multi-step process
during which the internal organs and the brain are removed,
packed in salt,
and stored in canopic jars.
"Which is…
just a…
fancy word…
for jars…
that hold…
someone's…
squishy bits,"
the mummy explained as they climbed the stairs
to an entrance in the side of the pyramid
that was actually quite large
but seemed quite small compared to the pyramid.

Third,
and perhaps most importantly,
zombies devoured the brains of the living.
"Or sometimes…
their livers…"
the mummy wheezed.
"It's a…
cultural…
thing."
Mummies,
on the other hand,
were strictly vegan:
*very* strictly,
since they didn't eat at all.
"Though…
we do…
like a…
nice cup…
of tea,"
the mummy added wistfully.

Two stone cats sat on their haunches at the top of the steps.
One blinked slowly as they entered the pyramid,
but other than that they might truly have been statues.
Inside was a corridor with sloping sides,
wide enough for the four of them to walk side by side.
Torches guttered in sconces every few dozen strides,
their light making the figures painted on the walls dance.<span class="sidenote">It didn't
occur to Finner until much later to wonder about the torches.
Were they some sort of magical everlasting torch?
Or were they delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays like the cheese his father was so fond of?
And why torches rather than lamps?
The mummy's rags looked awfully flammable…</span>

The corridor turned into a ramp,
which turned left and left again,
each leg slightly shorter than the one before.
Just as Finner realized they were climbing the inside of the pyramid
they reached their destination.
"Voila,"
the mummy rasped,
waving them forward proudly.

To call the chamber they entered a "room" would have been like calling the pyramid "large".
If Gran-Granna Tumbly's house had been tucked into one corner
there would still have been plenty of room for a hockey rink and a river barge.
And while there wasn't actually a hockey rink,
there *was* a barge,
along with dozens of statues,
a chariot,
six life-sized wooden horses,
a small catapult,
and a workbench covered with tools,
bits of wood,
rolls of fabric,
and a stack of magazines.

There was also something that looked suspiciously like Gran-Granna's living room.
"Please…
sit down…"
the mummy told them,
gesturing at a matched pair of blue-and-gold striped couches.
"I know…
it's not…
much…
to look at…
but…"

"Oh, it's amazing," the lean santa said
when the mummy's pause stretched longer than usual.
"And I *love* what you've done with the side tables."

"I…
refinished those…
myself,"
the mummy said proudly.
"Here…
let me…
show you…
the originals."
It pulled a magazine out of the pile on the workbench
and flipped through it,
muttering under its lack of breath.
"There!
What do…
you think?"

It thrust the magazine at the lean santa
while the burly one plopped himself down on the nearest couch,
which creaked slightly under his weight.
Finner sat hesitantly on the other
while the lean santa said appreciative things about stains and lacquers
and agreed that of *course* you had to see it in the room
to really appreciate it,
particularly with such difficult lighting.

"Excuse me," Finner finally interrupted,
after trying and failing twice to screw up enough courage to speak.
"But can someone please tell me what's going on?
And,
um,
how I can get home from here?
Because I'd like to do that.
if that's all right,"
he added apologetically.

"You can't get there from here,"
the lean santa said,
setting aside the filigree tea tray
that the mummy had casually mentioned was
an antique<span class="sidenote">By the standards of the living, anyway.</span>
"Emergency chimneys are one-way.
But I'm sure Sensei Tumbly is all right,"
she added.
"She's a tough old bird."

"Tough as they come," the burly santa agreed, nodding.
"Why, there was this time—"

"Why do you keep calling her that?"
Finner interrupted angrily.
"And where *are* we?
And would you *please* tell me what's going on,
and who you are?"

The three santas exchanged looks.
The lean santa sighed.
"I'm Santa Hood.
This is Santa Greenwood, and…?"

"Santa Hotep,"
the mummy supplied.

"And you're what, from an alternate universe?"
Finner asked.
"I'm not stupid," he added when Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.

"Alternate *universes*," she corrected.
"We're each the santa in our world.
Most only have one,"
she explained before Finner could ask.

"That sounds kind of lonely,"
was all Finner could think to say.

Santa Hood shrugged.
"It works out.
Some of the science elves think we're why all those universes exist.
Every kind of santa that can be, must be.
It's all very quantum."
She shrugged again.

"So what kind of santa are you?"
Finner asked.

She grinned wickedly.
"I'm the kind that steals presents from the rich and gives them to the poor."

Finner digested that for a moment.
"And you're the kind that chops down trees and gives everyone firewood as a gift?"
he asked Santa Greenwood.

"No,"
the burly man growled.
"The gifts are for the trees.
The ax is for anyone who tries to hurt 'em."

"I haven't…
brought anyone…
a gift…
in years,"
Santa Hotep wheezed wistfully in the awkward silence that followed.
"After…
the oasis…
dried up…
they all…
moved away.
It's peaceful…
but…
I do miss…
the unwrapping…
sometimes."

Santa Hood patted the mummy's hand.
"Well, you've certainly kept yourself busy.
This place looks *amazing*."

"I have…
Miz Tumbly…
to thank…
for that."
The mummy took a faded magazine off a lovely lacquered bookshelf,
its pages stiff with age.
"She felt…
sorry for me…
And started…
bringing me…
these.
It was…
the nicest thing.
I hope…
she's…
all right."
It paused.
"Or if not,"
it added reflectively,
"I hope…
Someone will…
wrap her.
It would…
be nice…
to have…
company."

"I'm sure Sensei Tumbly is fine,"
Santa Hood said firmly.
She stood and slung her sack over her shoulder with a wince.
"But we should keep moving.
Headquarters needs to know about the attack,
and we have to find a way to get Findlay here home"

"It's Finner, actually,"
Finner corrected,
or would have if an ear-splitting yowl hadn't interrupted them.

Santa Greenwood surged to his feet,
his ax in his hands,
as Santa Hotep drew a circle with its fingertip on the mirror by its elbow.
The mirror's surface rippled and reformed to show
the steps leading up to the pyramid entrance,
where the stone cats were fighting a quartet of small figures in hooded uniforms
wielding swords and rayguns
whose brilliant green beams left glassy scorches on the sand.<span class="sidenote">The rayguns,
that is.
Frankly, the swords were mostly for show.</span>

"Impossible,"
Santa Hotep wheezed angrily.
"They can't—"

"They have,"
Santa Hood snapped.
"We *really* need to get out of here."

Santa Hotep nodded.
"This way."
It shambled off,
moaning under its breath.<span class="sidenote">Even though it wasn't actually breathing.</span>

The chamber was even larger than Finner had realized.
He froze as one of the statues turned its head.
"Automated defenses,"
Santa Hood said without breaking stride.
"Pretty standard in a place like this.
I *am* a thief,"
she added over her shoulder.

Santa Hotep led them to a completely unremarkable patch of the wall.
"Left…
left…
right…
and ah…
whoopsie doo…"
it recited
as it did a slow shuffling dance.
The tiles beneath its feet went *click*.
With the slightest of scraping sounds
the enormous stone block in front of it pivoted
to reveal another passage,
smaller and narrower than the one they had climbed
but lit by the same flickering torches.

"After…
you…"
The mummy waved them ahead.
Santa Greenwood squeezed through the opening,
muttering under his breath.<span class="sidenote">He *was* actually breathing—rather noisily,
in fact.</span>
Finner followed with Santa Hood on his heels.

Up, up, up they went.
The passage cut back on itself so often that Finner began to feel dizzy.
He was just about to ask how much further it was
when he rounded a final bend and was almost blinded by
the bright blue square of empty sky in front of them.
That,
and the dazzling green beam of a raygun blast.

"Jet packs," Santa Greenwood spat
"Of *course* they'd have jet packs."
He brought up his ax
just in time for the next shot to bounce off its shiny blade.

"Where's the chimney?" Santa Hood demanded as the mummy caught up with them.

"Right…
in front…
of you…"
it wheezed.

"I don't see anything!" Santa Greenwood shouted,
deflecting another shot.
And then he bellowed, "AAAAHHH!"
because the mummy
(who was much stronger than it looked)
pushed all three of them out into the empty air
where they fell screaming to their deaths.

## Episode 5: In Which Our Protagonist Is Rescued at the Last Moment

At least,
that's what Finner expected would happen
in the heart-stopping second before the universe
did its "see it both ways" trick again
and the desert was an ocean,
a beautiful blue ocean with nice soft waves instead of nasty bone-breaking solid ground.

Santa Greenwood made the biggest splash:
between his size and hitting the water in a spread-eagle bellyflop,
he actually, briefly, made a dent in the water.
Finner had only a moment to admire how Santa Hood tucked in her elbows
to plunge into the water as gracefully as a seahawk diving for fish
before he discovered the hard way that the water was very, very cold.

He spluttered to the surface,
thrashing his arms against the weight of his suddenly-sodden coat.
It was heavy,
and his boots felt like concrete blocks on his feet.
"Help!" he spluttered.

"Periwinkle!" Santa Greenwood roared.

"I'm working on it!" Santa Hood shouted back.
She pulled something bright orange out of her sack.
With a sharp *pop!* and a hissing sound it began to inflate.

"Be careful with your stupid ax!" she yelled at Santa Greenwood
as she tossed her sack into the little dinghy.

"I'm bein' careful! And it ain't stupid!" the burly santa yelled back.
A dozen powerful one-armed strokes
and he dragged himself up onto the dinghy,
nearly flipping it over in the process.

Finner was too busy not drowning to really notice this, though.
He'd managed to kick off one boot<span class="sidenote">His mother always
told him to do up his laces properly so he didn't trip and break his neck.
It had never occurred to him to say,
"But what if I fall into another universe and need to kick them off so I don't drown?"</span>
and was struggling to unbutton his coat
when Santa Hood popped up beside him like an otter and said,
"Easy, easy, let me do that."

Panting and kicking furiously to stay afloat,
Finner squelched his panic long enough
for Santa Hood's deft fingers to undo his buttons
and hold his sleeves so that Finner could pull out his arms.
The heavy blue coat floated away,
taking with it a handkerchief,<span class="sidenote">Santas don't use kleenex.
That's for wrapping presents.</span>
a folded piece of paper with a game of Hangman on it
left over from a particularly boring writing class at school,
and a mostly uneaten piece of toffee.

A few moments later Santa Hood boosted Finner into the dinghy
and pulled herself over the gunwale as well.
"Y'aright?"
Santa Greenwood asked,
wringing seawater out of his beard.
He had a bit of seaweed in his hair,
Finner noticed.

Santa Hood nodded, shivering.
"Lucky th-this isn't of those worlds
where the ch-ch-chimney connects to a drowned city."

"Heh.
You remember Santa Kraken?"
Santa Greenwood shook himself like a very large dog
and laid his ax across his knees,
glaring at the ocean
as if a billion liters of salt water could be intimidated.

Santa Hood forced a smile,
her teeth chattering.
"Don't you have something in your sack to keep you warm?"
Finner asked,
hoping the answers would be "yes" and "I have a spare".

But Santa Hood shook her head.
"Used it a c-couple of chimneys ago."

Santa Greenwood patted her shoulder awkwardly.
"Well,
at least we're okay for now."

Right on cue,
a triangular gray fin sliced through the water beside them.
"Is there a Santa Shark?" Finner asked weakly,
hoping the answers would be "yes" and "it's actually very friendly".

Santa Hood shook her head.
"I'm af-fraid so," she said grimly,
her teeth still chattering.
"But she takes everything she c-can
and never g-gives *anything* back.
Be c-careful with that!" she snapped
as Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.

"I'm bein' careful!" Santa Greenwood said,
and then three things happened more or less simultaneously:<span class="sidenote">Whether
or not things happen at the same time depends in part on who you are.
If you're a helium atom,
for example,
you can expect to exist for billions of years,
so "at the same time" includes pretty much all of human civilization.</span>

1.  A second, larger gray fin appeared in the water beside the first.

2.  The edge of Santa Greenwood's ax brushed against the dinghy's rubber gunwale.

3.  There was a sharp *crack!*
    like someone snapping a piece of wood over their knee
    and a cannonball whistled over their heads.

"Look out!" Finner shouted instinctively as:

1.  The larger gray fin changed course to head straight for them.

2.  Air began feeping<span class="sidenote">A word that other worlds would do well to borrow.
    Our world's contribution would be "phlegm",
    which it sounds exactly like the thing it describes.</span> out of the dinghy;

3.  A set of black sails crested the horizon.
    There was another *crack!*
    and a second cannonball whistled overhead
    to splash into the water nearby.

Santa Greenwood stood up,
nearly causing the others to spill into the ocean
as the dinghy rocked dangerously.
"Come on, Periwinkle, gimme something!" he roared,
hefting his ax again.
"Chili grenades! Tangle muffins! Anything!"

"I'm out!" Santa Hood,
her arm deeper in her sack than basic physics should have allowed.<span class="sidenote">Basic physics
was actually quite uncomfortable about this,
but nobody thought to ask it.
Quantum physics would have just been, "Like, whatever."</span>

"Look!" Finner shouted
as a wooden ship crested the horizon.
It was painted the same menacing black as the sails.
There was an orange flash on her deck and another *crack!*.
A third cannonball hit the water between the dinghy and the circling gray fins.

"Ya gormless nabblers!" Santa Greenwood bellowed,
shaking his ax so hard that he lost his footing.
Finner grabbed the santa's belt to stop him from falling out of the dinghy
and was nearly pulled out himself.
"Why don'tcha come here an' try that, eh?"

A fourth *crack!*, another cannonball.
The ship was close enough now that Finner could see
crew in the rigging and on the deck
shouting and waving.
"Wait! They're not shooting at us!"
Finner exclaimed.
"They're shooting at the sharks!"

"Or they just can't aim!"
Santa Hood snapped,
her arm still deep in her sack.

And then the smaller gray fin decided it was now or never
and changed course and raced toward them.
The shark the fin belonged to was a menacing dark bulk just below the surface.

Finner could feel the dinghy softening beneath his bootless foot
as Santa Greenwood tried to stand up again
and Santa Hood ducked so as not to be beheaded by the ax
he actually wasn't being very careful with.
"Got it!" she said triumphantly.
She pulled something out of her sack and threw it.

There was a loud bang.
Sea water splattered all over them.
Finner's eyes immediately began itching and streaming.
"One last ch-chili bomb," Santa Hood said.

"Ahoy!" a distant voice called as the two gray fins turned and fled.<span class="sidenote">Or rather,
decided *quite independently of their changed circumstances*
that it was a good time to pursue other opportunities,
because sharks *never* "flee".</span>
"Might ye be in need of assistance there?"

Santa Greenwood's face fell.
"Oh, not him," he muttered.
"Anyone but him."

"Who?" Finner and Santa Hood asked simultaneously.

The black ship came up beside them.
Rope ladders were already draped over her side,
each with a sailor hanging from it with their arm out.
One, two, and *three* (Santa Greenwood being rather heavy)
and the dinghy was left empty in the ship's wake.<span class="sidenote">The dinghy
rather appreciated having some time to itself,
what with the first few minutes of its inflated existence
being so full of new experiences.
Then it sank,
which only goes to show—something.</span>

Finner clambered up the rope ladder and on to the deck.
Given recent events,
he was completely unsurprised to find himself face-to-face with another santa.
But what a santa:
between the eyepatch,
the skull earrings,
the peg leg,
the parrot (who had a peg leg of her own)
and the very large and very sharp cutlass in his hands,
*this* was the kind of santa other santas dreamed of being.

"Well, ain't you the lucky ones?" the santa boomed,
a twinkle in his eye.
"Us happenin' along just now an' all.
Coulda been mighty dicey there, mighty dicey indeed."

"We were doin' all right," Santa Greenwood muttered sullenly.

"Aye, I could see that," the pirate santa said,
straight-faced.
"Ah, but where's me manners?
I'm Cap'n Clausbeard,
an' this is my crew."
He waved his sword to include the dozen figures
now standing around and behind the new arrivals,
all of whom just happened to have sharp pieces of metal or thuddy things<span class="sidenote">I.e.,
things that go "thud" when they hit you.</span>
in their hands.

"This is Santa Hood,"
Santa Greenwood said reluctantly.
"And Figleaf—they're Miss Tumbly's."

"It's Finner," Finner corrected automatically.
No-one noticed.

The pause stretched awkwardly
until Santa Greenwood sighed heavily and gestured at Captain Clausbeard.
"And *this* is my dad."

## Episode 6: In Which Some Explanations Are Finally Given

A few busy minutes later,
Finner was sitting in a slightly cramped cabin
with a thick blanket wrapped around his shoulders
and a steaming mug of something called "seaweed tea" in his hands.
Santa Hood was somewhere under an even larger blanket on the bunk opposite his stool,
while Santa Greenwood had solved the problem of being too big for the available furniture
by sitting on the floor.
*Deck,* Finner corrected himself.
*It's called a deck on a ship.
Which this is.*

He shook himself.
"About the whole 'saving the worlds' thing," he ventured.

Santa Greenwood swallowed a swig<span class="sidenote">Which is what a "gulp" is called
when you're on a ship.</span> of tea
and set the mug on the deck beside his ax.
"They showed up a while back," he said,
looking at and through the wall opposite him.
"'Bout the time I was your age, actually, so maybe more than a while.
Anyway,
at first they were all talk.
Santas ought to do deliveries year round,
that kind of thing.
Made no sense,
but folk figured there was no harm in it."

"But who are 'they'?" Finner asked.

Santa Greenwood glanced at the blanket heaped on the bunk.
"A bunch of santas gone rogue," a muffled voice said.
"It happens sometimes,
especially on the worlds where there's only a few of each or even just one.
The loneliness gets to them after a while and they start making odd things or,
um,
unusual deliveries."<span class="sidenote">See the earlier note
about lifelike dolls.</span>

The tone of her voice made it clear that details wouldn't be forthcoming,
so instead Finner asked,
"What happened next?"

Santa Greenwood picked up his mug and scowled at its contents.
"When sensible folk wouldn't listen to them,
they took matters into their own hands.
They started makin' *stuff*."
His scowl deepened.
"Normal enough stuff, like socks and cutlery and what-not,
but more of it than anyone had ever seen.
And instead of puttin' it in the basement or a barn or something decent
until it was time to deliver it,
they just went and delivered it right away to—to *everyone*."

"In broad daylight," Santa Hood added tiredly
as Santa Greenwood glared into his tea.
"And they didn't care if people had been naughty or nice.
They gave presents to everyone."

"Didn't wrap 'em, either," Santa Greenwood added heatedly.
"Folk might've let them get away with it for a while
if they'd at least *wrapped* things,
but—"
He shook his head.
"It was disrespectful, is what it was."

"Mm."
Wrapping had never been Finner's favorite chore,<span class="sidenote">Though
it was still better than writing class.</span>
but the thought of what his parents or Gran-Granna Tumbly would say
if a present went into a sack without being wrapped made his stomach do flip-flops.
"So you tried to stop them aaand…?"

Santa Hood pulled her blanket down enough for her head to be visible.
"And it turned out there were more of them than people realized—a *lot* more.
It wasn't just a couple of worlds' worth—it was dozens of them."

"Hundreds!"
Santa Greenwood grunted.

"Hundreds,"
Santa Hood agreed.
"And just when everyone thought they couldn't do anything worse,
they let all their elves out of their basements.
Or caves, or, you know…"
She shrugged under her blanket.
"Wherever they'd been keeping their elves."

Finner's mouth went dry
the way it always did when he thought about elves.
"What do you mean?
My parents let our elves out all the time."

Santa Hood shook her head.
"I don't mean just to run errands and get parts and what-not.
They *let them out*.
They let them just walk around wherever they wanted
and have their own houses and make more of themselves,
as many more as they wanted."
Her eyes blazed.
"Do you have any idea how dangerous that could be?
One elf makes another so now you have two.
Each of them makes another, so now there's four,
then eight, then— then—"

"Sixteen," Finner supplied helpfully.<span class="sidenote">He
knew all the powers of two up to 4096.</span>

"Sixteen," Santa Hood agreed.
"Pretty soon there'd be more of them than us,
and then—"

"Elfageddon," Santa Greenwood finished solemnly.
"The end o' worlds.
No more presents, no more deliveries—no more santas, most like."

"I thought you said they wanted to make deliveries all the time."
Finner swallowed dryly at the looks the two santas gave him.

"They're not doin' deliveries," Santa Greenwood spat.
"They're just givin' people stuff."

"Giving who what?" boomed Captain Clausbeard,
who had just opened the cabin door without bothering to knock.
His parrot squawked something in his ear.
"Ah. Right. Them.
Anyway, what's it like bein' back in your old digs, eh, lad?
Must bring back memories, eh?"

Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.<span class="sidenote">*Purely by coincidence*
a slight shiver went down Finner's spine as she did so.</span>
"This was *your* cabin?"

Santa Greenwood growled but didn't reply.
Santa Hood jerked her chin at a pencil drawing of a tropical island
nailed up beside the cabin's single round porthole.
"I didn't know you were so artistic."

"Oh, my boy was a wizard with all that stuff,"
Captain Clausbeard said proudly.
"And even better at crochet.
Why, I still have a couple of doilies that—"

"I *think*," Santa Greenwood interrupted,
"I think we oughta focus on the problem at hand, don't you?
Namely how we're going to get Fiddler—"

"Finner."

"—back to Miz Tumbly
and how we're gonna get my elves and llamas back to *me*
and what in the name of rain we're going to do about these,
these troublemakers,
because I for one have had *enough*!"
He thumped his meaty fist on the deck,
making Captain Clausbeard's parrot<span class="sidenote">The parrot
would have been somewhat offended by this phrasing,
as she thought of the captain as being hers.
Luckily for our story,
the parrot only knew how to read *hangul*,
which is actually one of the most sensible alphabets ever created.</span> squawk.

Whatever the captain might have said in reply to that
was cut off by a cry from the crow's nest.
"Smoke, cap'n!
We got smoke on the horizon!"

The humor dropped from Captain Clausbeard's face like spilled porridge.
"You fit to fight?" he asked.

"Fit enough."
Santa Greenwood clambered to his feet,
swore as his head hit the ceiling,
and picked up his ax.

Captain Clausbeard nodded.
"Good lad.
Your friends can stay here 'til we know whether we're eatin' peaches or pickles.
That's an order," he added as Santa Hood opened her mouth.

"Yes cap'n," she said neutrally.

Captain Clausbeard raised an eyebrow<span class="sidenote">Which,
funnily enough,
didn't send a shiver down Finner's spine.</span>
but said nothing before stomping out,
his peg leg thumping on the deck.
"Avast, ye scallywags!" he bellowed.
The door closed behind him.

Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.
"Don't worry about us,"
Santa Hood said perkily,
wriggling a bit to free herself from her blanket's embrace.
"We'll be safe in here.
Besides, I'm not done studying this masterpiece of yours."

Finner expected Santa Greenwood to scowl or make a joke.
Instead, he spoke quietly, without looking at either of them.
"That's Isla del Tesoro.
It was my first forest.
More of a jungle, really,
but there were trees big as masts with these great beards o' moss hangin' off them.
The rest o' the crew didn't like it—they all got itchy
as soon as they were out of earshot o' the waves,
but you could walk for hours an' see nothin' that wasn't green.
First time I spent the night there felt like comin' home.
Drawin' that picture felt like makin' myself a promise.
Kinda surprised my dad left it up,
what with all the arguin' we did when I told him I was leavin'."

For a long moment the only sounds were the creaking of the ship's timbers
and muffled shouts from the crew.
"Don't worry about us,"
Santa Hood repeated,
her tone as soft as Santa Greenwood's had been.

Santa Greenwood nodded,
yanked the door open,
swore as his forehead hit the lintel,
and closed the door behind him.
Santa Hood rolled her head to work out a kind in her neck.
"So," she said conversationally,
letting the blanket slide down so that Finner could see
the ray gun she was holding,
which just happened to be aimed at his chest.
"How about you tell me who you really are?"
