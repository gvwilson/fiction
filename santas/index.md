## A Warning

*You probably think this is a Christmas story because of the santas,
but it's not.
It's about right and wrong and revolution,
about true love and the other kinds,
and about how by the time you go home it isn't really home any more.*

*There's one kiss and several explosions.
The footnotes are there to lighten things up,
but if you need a someone to hold your hand during the scary bits
you're out of luck—I'm just a book, and we don't have hands.*

## Episode 1: We Meet Our Protagonist

Once upon a time,
in a world halfway between yours and mine,
lived a young santa named Finner.
He came from a long line of santas:
his mother had boxed and wrapped her first wind-up singing wombat
when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself,
while his father started helping with deliveries
as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.<span class="note">
There's a story behind the word "reliably" in that sentence,
but it's best told some other time.
</span>

Everyone could tell that Finner was a santa the moment he was born:
people said his tiny little beard was the cutest thing they'd ever seen.
And as he grew up,
he loved santafying—at least, he tried to.
After all,
who *wouldn't* enjoy slithering down a sooty chimney
or trying to land a sleigh on a yurt without leaving a single dent in its stiff felt roof?
But no matter what he did,
a small voice in Finner's head said, "Me.
I don't enjoy this.
Or rather, I do, but it's not enough."

What he *did* enjoy,
at least for a while,
was going into the workshop and helping the family's elves.
The smell of solder,
the *shick shick* of freshly-sharpened scissors,
the feeling of the two halves of a dovetail joint fitting perfectly together—they
felt right in a way that clambering up the icy concrete side of an apartment building
never did.

His parents tolerated it at first.
"Good for him to know how things are made,"
they told each other.
After a while, though,
they began hinting that maybe he should being ho-ho-ho'ing in the attic
rather than sewing or gluing.
And a while after that,
Finner could tell that the hints were about to become
a number three talk from his father,<span class="note">Direct eye contact,
patient but serious voice,
lots of awkward pauses on both sides,
every other sentence starting, "Your mother and I think…"</span>
so he put the tools he had borrowed from the elves back in their boxes
and pretended he couldn't hear their hammering any longer.

And so Finner became more restless every day.
His mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over
to burn off the energy,
but it only made him sweaty.
He tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes closed
and humming softly to himself like the monks of Lotse Nuffin,<span class="note">
The monks were his father's favorite clients.
They wanted nothing,
so every year that's exactly what he took them,
and they were always grateful.
</span>
but all he got was a cold bum.

He tried to talk to his friends about it
without actually explaining the problem,
but that didn't go well.
Finner's parents weren't the only santas in town.
There were others nearby—aunts and uncles
and second cousins twice removed
and even a few who'd married into the trade
and done quite well for themselves
despite what Finner's great-grandmother never actually said out loud at family gatherings.<span class="note">
She was a hundred and twenty two years old,
and could not say things so loudly that no one else could hear themselves think.</span>
But they were all related to him somehow,
and none of the other children Finner went to school with or played hide and seek with
really understood the problem.
Santas didn't *make* things—they *delivered* them.
That's how it was,
that's how it had always been,
and as far as everyone was concerned,
that was how it was always going to be.

For a while he wondered if he was just lazy,
which was a synonym for "sinful" where he lived,
so he tried a few experiments.
Working twice as hard made him even sweatier than running up and down stairs.
Working half as hard made his father ask if he was sick and his mother mutter about teenagers.
Neither made the yearning in his chest for *something* go away.
It grew and grew until finally,
desperately,
he realized there was only one thing left for him to do.
He would have to ask his great-grandmother for advice.

Gran-Granna Tumbly spent most of her time napping,
but she had been one of the greatest santas ever.
She had once delivered a chocolate orange cake to a trio of scientists in a submarine
*without using a submarine herself*,
and then delivered a baby on the way home.<span class="note">
"Delivered" in the conventional sense of helping someone give birth
rather than the postal sense used for packages.
Elves did make dolls sometimes that were so lifelike normal people though they were real,
and (whisper it) sometimes santas would deliver them in the dead of night when most people were sleeping
and take a real child in exchange,
but we're not at that part of the story yet.
</span>
Everyone was a little bit afraid of her,
except for the unfortunate few who had felt the full force of her disapproving glare:
they were a *lot* afraid.
But if you had a problem—a *real* problem,
not just a lost sock or a broken heart<span class="note">Gran-Granna Tumbly
did once make an exception for someone whose heart was broken
because they had lost a very special sock
and there was a very real chance of the world ending as a result,
but that story is also best told some other time.</span>—you could
always knock on her door.

Finner waited until Tuesday afternoon before going to see her.
The postman delivered<span class="note">In the postal sense of the word.</span>
her weekly order of chocolate on Tuesday just before lunch,
and Finner hoped that would put her in a good mood.
"Or at least a less grumpy one," he thought
as he trudged through the damp, clumpy snow that had fallen overnight.
The last time he had seen her had been the family gathering at Long Night the year before.
Finner's uncle had accidentally served Gran-Granna a cup of camomile tea,
and had squirmed for an hour as she drank it one slow, withering sip at a time.

The Tumbly house looked exactly like those on either side of it:
a front door with an evergreen wreath on it,
a large curtained window to one side,
and a pair of smaller windows with matching curtains on the floor above.
The downstairs window had a warm, welcoming glow,
and even from the street Finner could smell curry and freshly-baked bread.
The only remarkable thing was a statue of a cat sitting on an round pedestal
in the middle of the front yard,
its stone eyes fixed on a snow-filled bird bath.<span class="note">The houses on either side
had a miniature Ferris wheel
and a model locomotive in their front yards,
though,
so to be fair,
the statue wasn't *that* remarkable.</span>

Finner took a deep breath, walked up to the door, and knocked.
When nothing happened he knocked again.
"Well that was a bust," he said aloud,
secretly relieved.

"She just nipped out to get some broccoli," a voice rumbled behind him.
"If you don't mind waiting a moment…?"

Finner turned around slowly.
The stone cat had turned its head toward him,
but was clearly still keeping one eye on the empty bird bath.
"I—sure," he said lamely,
then added, "Thank you,"
because a stone statue of a cat is still in some sense a cat,
and one of the first lessons a santa is taught is
to always be polite to cats.<span class="note">And watchmakers,
but that's also—you know what?
If it really is a story for another time,
then from now on we'll just not mention it.</span>

"Of course," the cat rumbled.
It turned its head back toward the bird bath,
and together they waited in silence.

They didn't have to wait long.
A tricycle taxi rolled up in front of the house and wheezed to a gentle stop.
The taxi pedaller climbed out of his seat,
stretched until his spine went *pop!*,
nodded at Finner (or possibly the cat),
and then opened the cab door and helped Gran-Granna Tumbly down.
Pocketing the half-coins she handed him,
he climbed back onto his seat and pedalled away.

Finner belatedly remembered that he was an able-bodied youth
and Gran-Granna was neither.
"Can I carry that for you?" he asked,
hurrying back down the short walk to the gate.

Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at the broccoli in her hand and snorted.
"I think I can manage, thank you," she said.
"Did you catch anything?"

"Uh…" Finner started, confused.

"No," the cat statue rumbled.
"But I remain hopeful."

"Hmph."
Finner stepped out of the way as Gran-Granna Tumbly walked briskly up the path,
the tip of her cane stabbing through the snow on every second step.
"Well, since you're here, you might as well come in."

"Yes'm," Finner said obediently.
With one last glance at the motionless cat he followed her through the door
and into the rest of his life.

## Episode 2: A Door Opens

Finner had never actually been in Gran-Granna's house before,
but he'd heard stories.
A richly-patterned carpet in the hall that looked like it might once have been able to fly: check.
A set of coathooks with gargoyle faces: check.<span class="note">Which were actually just
pieces of wood carved to look like gargoyle faces.
It wouldn't be necessary to clarify this for most people.</span>
A sitting room filled with a riot of greenery and a mis-matched pair of overstuffed chairs: check.
Crossed harpoons over the fireplace and dozens of framed pictures
of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, neighbors, friends, enemies<span class="note">Some of which
had dates and locations written on them in neat, smug lettering.</span>,
and the grateful, if somewhat perplexed, crew of a submarine: check.

And there was a teapot—*the* teapot,
the one people spoke about in hushed voices.
It didn't look special,
but it was never empty and its contents were never cold.
Bitter, sometimes,
if that's what guests needed,
but never cold.

Finner waited for Gran-Granna to settle into a chair
before seating himself nervously on the edge of the other one.
She spooned a bit of sugar into a green-and-white teacup,
glanced at him,
added a bit more,
and then poured slowly and carefully.
"You'll want to let that cool down a bit," she advised,
filling the second cup for herself
and sitting back with it cradled in her hands.

"Thank you,"
Finner said,
not knowing what else to say.
What *was* he going to say?
"Nothing feels right," was awfully vague,
and, "What should I do with my life?" seemed awfully—

"The thing about being old," Gran-Granna said without any preamble,
"Is that people think it makes you wise."

The silence that followed was broken only by
the ticking of the burl clock in the kitchen.
"Doesn't it?" Finner asked,
because it felt like the kind of statement
that wanted to be invited to take off its coat and sit for a while.

"Not so far as I can tell,"
Gran-Granna sighed.
She sipped her tea,
eyes half-closed like a cat having its ears scratched.
"But it does give you a passel of stories to tell.
Take your Auncle Minglin, for example."
She gestured at a picture on the wall of someone Finner vaguely remembered
having spilled cranberry juice on a white tablecloth at some point.
"Kind heart,
and a beautiful singing voice,
but as clumsy as an ox on ice skates.
They could trip over a rock that was clear across the other side of the street."

"So no deliveries?"
Finner ventured.

"That's certainly the conclusion they reached.
And they were pretty down in the mouth about it,
let me tell you.
The world needs doctors and zeppelin pilots and what-not,
but when when you've been told your whole life that you're destined for something else,
well,
it's hard to change direction."

Finner turned his teacup around in his hands.
"So what happened to them?"

Gran-Granna smiled.
"They ran off and joined the opera.
Last I heard,
they were singing six shows a week with not an empty seat in the house."
She sipped her tea.
"The way I look at it,
they *did* become a santa.
They're giving people the gift of music night after night
and that's no small thing."

She sighed.
"But they don't see it that way,
and I don't know if they ever will.
Doesn't matter how hard people applaud
or how many times they're called back for encores—deep in their heart,
they'll always think of themself as 'not at santa'."

"Which brings us to you," she continued,
bright eyes fixed on Finner,
who at that moment desperately regretted having come to see her
and wished he could be almost anywhere else in the world.<span class="note">"Almost",
because he had taken geography in school and knew about volcanoes.</span>

"M-me?" Finner stammered.

"Yes, y-you," Gran-Granna said impatiently.
"Your folks have been worried about you for a while now.
Oh, I know, you didn't think anyone had noticed,
but you've been mopey and anxious
and all the other things young people get carried away with these days,
only more so."

A clock chimed quietly in the kitchen next door.
Somewhere in the distance,
someone called for their children to come inside,
it was time for bed and their teeth weren't going to brush themselves.
"I just don't know what to do," Finner confessed,
angry at the tears that he was absolutely *not* going to cry.
"I like the ho-ho-ho'ing,
but deliveries are—"
He paused for breath.
"It's like everyone else is excited about it but I'm just watching myself do it,
you know?
Like this is someone else's life and I've just put it on like a sweater
except it doesn't quite fit
and no matter how many times I wash it,
it'll still smell a bit like whoever it really belongs to."

"Hmph,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly snorted.
"Fancy words like that,
maybe you ought to think about becoming a writer."

"Maybe," Finner mumbled.<span class="note">He'd written stories and poems for school.
Doing it made volcanoes seem attractive.</span>

*THUMP!* He jumped as something heavy hit the floor in the room overhead.
"What was that?"

Gran-Granna picked up her cane and struggled to her feet.
"Dearie me, look at the time," she said curtly.
"I'm sure your folks will be wondering where you are.
You best be—"

*THUMP!* "Ow, get off me!" a female voice said peevishly.

Finner reached for his great-grandmother.
"I think someone's up there," he whispered loudly.

Gran-Granna rolled her eyes.
"Door," she said, pointing at it with her cane.
"You. Through it. Now."

"Vidancia! Vidancia, where are you?"
a second voice bellowed from above.

"Quiet!" the first voice said.

"Vidanci-ulp!"
Finner practically heard someone putting their hand over someone else's mouth.

He gestured weakly toward the front door.
"Well, um, I'll just—" he started.

Heavy boots thumped on carpeted steps
as the biggest, beardiest santa Finner had ever seen came downstairs
and wrapped his arms around Gran-Granna Tumbly in a number three hug.<span class="note">Both arms,
full wrap,
strong squeeze for two or three heartbeats depending on how bad things are.</span>
To Finner's complete surprise the santa started crying.

"Oh Vidancia," he blubbered.
"It's awful.
It's *awful*."

Gran-Granna Tumbly wriggled out of the beard and the hug.
"Let me guess—did your llamas eat your favorite hat again?"

"The llamas are gone,"
said a second santa
who had come silently down the stairs behind the first one.
She was no taller than Finner,
but lean where the first santa was brawny,
and her uniform—Finner did a double take.
Her hood and sack were red and white,
but the rest was changing color to match the carpet on the stairs.
And—was that an ax strapped to the first santa's back?
A really big ax that looked like it was designed for chopping off heads
rather than for turning logs into kindling?

"What do you mean 'gone'?" Gran-Granna demanded,
pulling a handkerchief out of her sleeve and handing it to the big santa
in a way that clearly meant,
"Stop sniffling and get ahold of yourself."

"I mean they are gone.
No longer in their proper surroundings.
Ex-located.
Completely, utterly, elsewhere."
The second santa sat down heavily on the stairs.

"You're hurt," Gran-Granna said accusingly.

The second santa waved her off.
"It's nothing.
Just some broken ribs.
And maybe an eardrum.
One of my presents went off a little early,"
she added with a wicked grin.

The burly santa wiped his eyes on a sleeve that Finner could have used as a sleeping bag.
"The elves were helpin' me load up the stagecoach for a delivery,
just like they always do,
an' then *blam!*"
He smacked a meaty fist into an equally meaty palm.
"There they were,
all over us.
I tried to fight 'em off, Vidancia, I swear."
His lower lip trembled.

"I know you did," Gran-Granna said gently.
"What about your elves?"

"Out through the emergency chimney,"
the second santa said.
She shifted and winced.
"They're safe.
At least,
as safe as anyone right now."

She turned her gaze on Finner.
Something very much like a mild electric shock ran down his spine
as her dark eyes locked with his.
"And who's this?" she asked.

Before anyone could answer there was another pair of *thumps* upstairs.
"Well," a somewhat disappointed voice buzzed a moment later.
"It's not exactly a palace, is it?"

The burly santa growled and reached for his ax.
The one on the stairs struggled to her feet.
"They're here," she spat.

"So it appears,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly said grimly.
She twisted the head of her cane
and to Finner's absolute dumbfoundment<span class="note">Yes, that really is a word.</span>
drew a slender silver rapier.
"Hold this," she ordered,
handing the remaining cane-y bit of the cane to Finner,
and then everything went a little bit nuts.

## Episode 3: A Moderate Amount of Mayhem Occurs

The second santa pulled a grenade out of her sack,
drew the pin with her teeth,
and chucked it overhand up the stairs.
"Bang," she said calmly.
Sure enough,
a second later there was a loud, sharp *crack!*
Bilious green foam began expanding into the stairs.

"That won't hold them for long,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly said,
twisting at the waist until her spine made a noise
made a *crack* of its own that was only slightly quieter than the grenade's.

"We can take 'em!" the big santa bellowed,
hefting his totally intimidating ax,
which was in fact larger than Finner.

"No we can't," Gran-Granna snapped.
A UPF<span class="note">Unidentified Piece of Furniture. It's like a flying saucer,
except it's rectangular (usually),
doesn't fly (unless it's thrown very hard),
and (probably) isn't of alien origin.</span> crashed through a window upstairs
and landed in the front yard with a wet *thud*.
Boots clattered on the porch roof.

"That window *does* open," Gran-Granna Tumbly muttered.
Sparkles ran down the rapier in her hand.

"Is that a *magic* sword?" Finner breathed.

"Not magic enough," their great-grandmother snapped.
"You two! Chimney! Now! And you."
She pointed at Finner.
"You go with them and you do exactly what they say, understand?"

"Go where?" Finner didn't have a chance to ask,
because at precisely that moment something roared in the front yard.
It was the kind of sound that bypasses the ears
and goes directly to the bit in the back of the brain
that evolved to keep a million generations of ancestors
out of the stomachs of large predators.

"What—" someone in the front yard started to say but never managed to finish.
Someone else simply screamed, briefly.
A sound like a dozen empty cans being crunched together
was followed by a moment of stunned silence,
and then the shooting started.

The burly santa yanked Finner under the shelter of his enormous ax.
Bullets ricocheted off it to make lethal little holes in the pictures on the walls.
The other santa dove across the room to take shelter beside Finner.
Punctured in a dozen places,
the green foam in the stairs made a wet, farty noise
and began to deflate.

"Get to the chimney!" Gran-Granna Tumbly shouted.
Her sword flashed back and forth,
knocking bullets away from them.<span class="note">Or possibly from her teapot.
Finner wondered about that later.</span>

The big santa picked him up like a sack of laundry
and took two enormous strides across the room
and something *twisted*,
Finner didn't see exactly what or how,
but suddenly Gran-Granna's fireplace was gone,
or rather it was still there but it was also a doorway,
like one of those puzzle pictures that looks like two different things at once,
and then everything stretched around them
or possibly they did the stretching
and they were somewhere else.

It was bright.
In fact,
it was daytime,
when a moment ago it had been dark and evening.
And there was sand—lots of sand.
And—

"That looks like a pyramid,"
a small part of Finner's brain<span class="note">Not the part that evolved
to keep him out of predators—pyramids weren't really its concern.</span> told the rest of him.

The second santa got to her feet and brushed sand off her uniform,
which had already started to turn a dusty beige.
"Where are we?" she asked.

It took Finner a moment to realize she was asking him.
"I don't know," he said helplessly.
It was hot, he realized.
Much too hot for the winter coat he was wearing.
And where was Gran-Granna?

The santa stared at him.
Her eyes widened.
"He doesn't know," she said to the big santa.

"That's what I said," Finner was about to reply,
but before he could,
a voice behind him moaned,
"Greeeetinnngs…"

He spun around and found himself face-to-face with—he wasn't quite sure what.
It was tall and withered
and wrapped in tattered bandages
made from the rags of what might once have been a santa's uniform.
Its eyes didn't quite line up,
and—was that a *bone* of the end of one of its arms
where there really ought to be a hand?<span class="note">Even a mechanical hand would have been okay.
Finner had an aunt who had started wearing one
after an encounter with a particularly militantß guard goose,
and more than a few of his mother's elvish friends had needed mechanical upgrades
after what people referred to as "workshop incidents".</span>

The burly santa hefted his ax.
"Friend or foe?" he demanded.

The mummy santa smiled, or more accurately bared its large, yellow teeth.
"That depends on…
whether you brought…
tea.
And treats…
for my pets."
At the word "treats",
one of the giant cat statues at the base of the pyramid
turned its head and blinked,
which made the "stay out of predators" part of Finner's brain go, "Ding ding ding!"

"Tea?" the burly santa asked,
clearly never having had this particular response to his friend-or-foe question before.

"She always…
brings tea.
And treats.
And sometimes…
a magazine?"
the mummy santa finished hopefully.

"No magazines, I'm afraid, and no tea either,"
the lean santa said,
her uniform a perfect match for the sand around them.
"We had to leave Sensei Tumbly's in rather a hurry."

"Ssss…"
The mummy hissed with disappointment.
"I suppose…
you're going…
to claim…
refuge?"

The lean santa elbowed her burly companion's ribs to stop him from speaking.
"As is our right," she said.
"A cookie, a glass of milk, and the use of your chimney."

"Heh.
Heh.
Heh."
The mummy said the words one by one with somewhat unsettling pauses between them.
"No milk…
or cookies…
here.
Not for…
a long…
time."
The giant stone cat behind it stepped down from its pedestal.
Finner gulped as three more joined it.
Some seemed to be missing minor parts like ears or tails,
but that didn't do anything to quiet the *ding ding ding!* in his brain.
"So tell me…
why I…
should say yes?"

The lean santa reached into her sack.
For a heartbeat Finner thought she was going to throw another foam grenade,
but instead she pulled out a complicated piece of clockwork
that had probably been breathtaking before
the explosion that had clearly bent some of the gears
and left scorch marks on others.

The mummy hissed again.
"You bring…
*that*…
here!?"

The santa hefted her sack.
Loose pieces of metal clinked against one another.
The mummy hissed again,
and the cats around it growled.
"Oh, don't be a bunny," the santa said dismissively.
"It would take a dozen elves a week to put it back together,
and anyway,
I didn't manage to salvage a battery."
She jerked her chin at the santa with the ax.
"They found a way through his chimney.
And took his llamas."

"*And* smashed my stagecoach,"
the big santa added.
"'Least I got my elves away safe."

The lean santa shook her head.
"Safe for now,
but if we don't figure out where they're coming from
or how they're using the chimneys,
they're going to take away everything we care about."
She was exhausted,
Finner realized,
but trying hard not to show it.

The mummy hissed sympathetically.
"I know…
how…
you feel…
child."
It looked past her at the dry sand surrounding them.
"This was…
green…
once…
But that…
was long ago…"

One of the stone cats yowled softly.
The mummy straightened.
"Yes…
I will…
grant you…
refuge.
Follow…
me."

It turned toward the pyramid,
then hesitated.
"And…
please…
don't mind…
the mess.
I'm…
redecorating."

As they climbed the worn stone steps on the pyramid
Finner sidled over to the lean santa.
"Can you please tell me what's going on?"

She sighed.
"The usual, I'm afraid.
We're trying to save the worlds."

## Episode 4: Some Introductions are Made

Zombies and mummies are similar in many ways—the shambling gait,
the moaning,
and of course the whole "undead" thing—but
there are important differences.
First,
mummies are generally royalty,
or the servants of royalty,
while zombies tend to have been idiots who went into the basement after dark
despite the strange sounds they heard
or didn't run fast enough when someone shouted,
"Look out, they're coming!"
Second,
mummies are created through a complex multi-step process
during which the internal organs and the brain are removed,
packed in salt,
and stored in canopic jars.
"Which is…
just a…
fancy word…
for jars…
that hold…
someone's…
squishy bits,"
the mummy explained as they climbed the stairs
to an entrance in the side of the pyramid
that was actually quite large
but seemed quite small compared to the pyramid.

Third,
and perhaps most importantly,
zombies devoured the brains of the living.
"Or sometimes…
their livers…"
the mummy wheezed.
"It's a…
cultural…
thing."
Mummies,
on the other hand,
were strictly vegan:
*very* strictly,
since they didn't eat at all.
"Though…
we do…
like a…
nice cup…
of tea,"
the mummy added wistfully.

Two stone cats sat on their haunches at the top of the steps.
One blinked slowly as they entered the pyramid,
but other than that they might truly have been statues.
Inside was a corridor with sloping sides,
wide enough for the four of them to walk side by side.
Torches guttered in sconces every few dozen strides,
their light making the figures painted on the walls dance.<span class="note">It didn't
occur to Finner until much later to wonder about the torches.
Were they some sort of magical everlasting torch?
Or were they delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays like the cheese his father was so fond of?
And why torches rather than lamps?
The mummy's rags looked awfully flammable…</span>

The corridor turned into a ramp,
which turned left and left again,
each leg slightly shorter than the one before.
Just as Finner realized they were climbing the inside of the pyramid
they reached their destination.
"Voila,"
the mummy rasped,
waving them forward proudly.

To call the chamber they entered a "room" would have been like calling the pyramid "large".
If Gran-Granna Tumbly's house had been tucked into one corner
there would still have been plenty of room for a hockey rink and a river barge.
And while there wasn't actually a hockey rink,
there *was* a barge,
along with dozens of statues,
a chariot,
six life-sized wooden horses,
a small catapult,
and a workbench covered with tools,
bits of wood,
rolls of fabric,
and a stack of magazines.

There was also something that looked suspiciously like Gran-Granna's living room.
"Please…
sit down…"
the mummy told them,
gesturing at a matched pair of blue-and-gold striped couches.
"I know…
it's not…
much…
to look at…
but…"

"Oh, it's amazing," the lean santa said
when the mummy's pause stretched longer than usual.
"And I *love* what you've done with the side tables."

"I…
refinished those…
myself,"
the mummy said proudly.
"Here…
let me…
show you…
the originals."
It pulled a magazine out of the pile on the workbench
and flipped through it,
muttering under its lack of breath.
"There!
What do…
you think?"

It thrust the magazine at the lean santa
while the burly one plopped himself down on the nearest couch,
which creaked slightly under his weight.
Finner sat hesitantly on the other
while the lean santa said appreciative things about stains and lacquers
and agreed that of *course* you had to see it in the room
to really appreciate it,
particularly with such difficult lighting.

"Excuse me," Finner finally interrupted,
after trying and failing twice to screw up enough courage to speak.
"But can someone please tell me what's going on?
And,
um,
how I can get home?
Because I'd like to do that.
if that's all right,"
he added apologetically.

"You can't get there from here,"
the lean santa said,
setting aside the filigree tea tray
that the mummy had casually mentioned was
an antique<span class="note">By the standards of the living, anyway.</span>
"Emergency chimneys are one-way.
But I'm sure Sensei Tumbly is all right,"
she added quickly.
"She's a tough old bird."

"Tough as they come," the burly santa agreed, nodding.
"Why, there was this time—"

"Why do you keep calling her that?"
Finner interrupted angrily.
"And where *are* we?
And would you *please* tell me what's going on,
and who you are?"

The three santas exchanged looks.
The lean santa sighed.
"I'm Santa Hood.
This is Santa Greenwood, and…?"

"Santa Hotep,"
the mummy supplied.

"And this is what, an alternate universe?"
Finner asked.
"I'm not stupid," he added when Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.

"It's one of them," she confirmed.
"We're each the santa in our world.
A lot only have one,"
she explained before Finner could ask.

"That sounds kind of lonely,"
was all Finner could think to say.

Santa Hood shrugged.
"It works out.
Some people think we're why all those universes exist.
Every kind of santa that can be, must be.
It's some kind of quantum thing."
She shrugged again.

"So what kind of santa are you?"
Finner asked.

She grinned wickedly.
"I'm the kind that steals presents from the rich and gives them to the poor."

Finner digested that for a moment.
"And you're the kind that chops down trees and gives everyone firewood as a gift?"
he asked Santa Greenwood.

"No,"
the burly man growled.
"The gifts are for the trees.
The ax is for anyone who tries to hurt 'em."

"I haven't…
brought anyone…
a gift…
in years,"
Santa Hotep wheezed wistfully in the awkward silence that followed.
"After…
the oasis…
dried up…
they all…
moved away.
It's peaceful…
but…
I do miss…
the unwrapping…
sometimes."

Santa Hood patted the mummy's hand.
"Well, you've certainly kept yourself busy.
This place looks *amazing*."

"I have…
Miz Tumbly…
to thank…
for that."
The mummy took a faded magazine off a lovely lacquered bookshelf,
its pages stiff with age.
"She felt…
sorry for me…
And started…
bringing me…
these.
It was…
the nicest thing.
I hope…
she's…
all right."
It paused.
"Or if not,"
it added reflectively,
"I hope…
Someone will…
wrap her.
It would…
be nice…
to have…
company."

"I'm sure Sensei Tumbly is fine,"
Santa Hood said firmly.
She stood and slung her sack over her shoulder with a wince.
"But we should keep moving.
Headquarters needs to know about the attack,
and we have to find a way to get Findlay here home"

"It's Finner, actually,"
Finner corrected,
or would have if an ear-splitting yowl hadn't interrupted them.

Santa Greenwood surged to his feet,
his ax in his hands,
as Santa Hotep drew a circle with its fingertip on the mirror by its elbow.
The mirror's surface rippled and reformed to show
the steps leading up to the pyramid entrance,
where the stone cats were fighting a quartet of hooded figures
wielding swords and rayguns
whose brilliant green beams left glassy scorches on the sand.<span class="note">The rayguns,
that is.
Frankly, the swords were mostly for show.</span>

"Impossible,"
Santa Hotep wheezed angrily.
"They can't—"

"They have,"
Santa Hood snapped.
"We need to get out of here *right now*."

Santa Hotep nodded.
"This way."
It shambled off,
moaning under its breath.<span class="note">Even though it wasn't actually breathing.</span>

The chamber was even larger than Finner had realized.
He froze as one of the statues turned its head.
"Automated defenses,"
Santa Hood said without breaking stride.
"Pretty standard in a place like this.
I *am* a thief,"
she added over her shoulder.

Santa Hotep led them to a completely unremarkable patch of the wall.
"Left…
left…
right…
and ah…
whoopsie doo…"
it recited
as it did a slow shuffling dance.
The tiles beneath its feet went *click*.
With the slightest of scraping sounds
the enormous stone block in front of it pivoted
to reveal another passage,
smaller and narrower than the one they had climbed
but lit by the same flickering torches.

"After…
you…"
The mummy waved them ahead.
Santa Greenwood squeezed through the opening,
muttering under his breath.<span class="note">He *was* actually breathing—rather noisily,
in fact.</span>
Finner followed with Santa Hood on his heels.

Up, up, up they went.
The passage cut back on itself so often that Finner began to feel dizzy.
He was just about to ask how much further it was
when he rounded a final bend and was almost blinded by
the bright blue square of empty sky in front of them.
That,
and the dazzling green beam of a raygun blast.

"Jet packs," Santa Greenwood spat
"Of *course* they'd have jet packs."
He brought up his ax
just in time for the next shot to bounce off its shiny blade.

"Where's the chimney?" Santa Hood demanded as the mummy caught up with them.

"Right…
in front…
of you…"
it wheezed.

"I don't see anything!" Santa Greenwood shouted,
deflecting another shot.
And then he bellowed, "AAAAHHH!"
because the mummy
(who was much stronger than it looked)
pushed all three of them out into the empty air
where they fell screaming to their deaths.

## Episode 5: Our Protagonist Is Rescued at the Last Moment

At least,
that's what Finner expected would happen
in the heart-stopping second before the universe
did its "see it both ways" trick again
and the desert was an ocean,
a beautiful blue ocean with nice soft waves instead of nasty bone-breaking solid ground.

Santa Greenwood made the biggest splash:
between his size and hitting the water in a spread-eagle bellyflop,
he actually, briefly, made a dent in the water.
Finner had only a moment to admire how Santa Hood tucked in her elbows
to plunge into the water as gracefully as a seahawk diving for fish
before he discovered the hard way that the water was very, very cold.

He spluttered to the surface,
thrashing his arms against the weight of his suddenly-sodden coat.
It was heavy,
and his boots felt like concrete blocks on his feet.
"Help!" he spluttered.

"Periwinkle!" Santa Greenwood roared.

"I'm working on it!" Santa Hood shouted back.
She pulled something bright orange out of her sack.
With a sharp *pop!* and a hissing sound it began to inflate.

"Be careful with your stupid ax!" she yelled at Santa Greenwood
as she tossed her sack into the little dinghy.

"I'm bein' careful! And it ain't stupid!" the burly santa yelled back.
A dozen powerful one-armed strokes
and he dragged himself up onto the dinghy,
nearly flipping it over in the process.

Finner was too busy not drowning to really notice this, though.
He'd managed to kick off one boot<span class="note">His mother always
told him to do up his laces properly so he didn't trip and break his neck.
It had never occurred to him to say,
"But what if I fall into another universe and need to kick them off so I don't drown?"</span>
and was struggling to unbutton his coat
when Santa Hood popped up beside him like an otter and said,
"Easy, easy, let me do that."

Panting and kicking furiously to stay afloat,
Finner squelched his panic long enough
for Santa Hood's deft fingers to undo his buttons
and hold his sleeves so that Finner could pull out his arms.
The heavy blue coat floated away,
taking with it a handkerchief,<span class="note">Santas don't use kleenex.
That's for wrapping presents.</span>
a folded piece of paper with a game of Hangman on it
left over from a particularly boring writing class at school,
and a mostly uneaten piece of toffee.

A few moments later Santa Hood boosted Finner into the dinghy
and pulled herself over the gunwale as well.
"Y'aright?"
Santa Greenwood asked,
wringing seawater out of his beard.
He had a bit of seaweed in his hair,
Finner noticed.

Santa Hood nodded, shivering.
"Lucky th-this isn't of those worlds
where the ch-ch-chimney connects to a drowned city."

"Heh.
You remember Santa Kraken?"
Santa Greenwood shook himself like a very large dog
and laid his ax across his knees,
glaring at the ocean
as if a billion liters of salt water could be intimidated.

Santa Hood forced a smile,
her teeth chattering.
"Don't you have something in your sack to keep you warm?"
Finner asked,
hoping the answers would be "yes" and "I have a spare".

But Santa Hood shook her head.
"Used it a c-couple of chimneys ago."

Santa Greenwood patted her shoulder awkwardly.
"Well,
at least we're okay for now."

Right on cue,
a triangular gray fin sliced through the water beside them.
"Is there a Santa Shark?" Finner asked weakly,
hoping the answers would be "yes" and "it's actually very friendly".

Santa Hood shook her head.
"I'm af-fraid so," she said grimly,
her teeth still chattering.
"But she takes everything she c-can
and never g-gives *anything* back.
Be c-careful with that!" she snapped
as Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.

"I'm bein' careful!" Santa Greenwood said,
and then three things happened more or less simultaneously:<span class="note">Whether
or not things happen at the same time depends in part on who you are.
If you're a helium atom,
for example,
you can expect to exist for billions of years,
so "at the same time" includes pretty much all of human civilization.</span>

1.  A second, larger gray fin appeared in the water beside the first.

2.  The edge of Santa Greenwood's ax brushed against the dinghy's rubber gunwale.

3.  There was a sharp *crack!*
    like someone snapping a piece of wood over their knee
    and a cannonball whistled over their heads.

"Look out!" Finner shouted instinctively as:

1.  The larger gray fin changed course to head straight for them.

2.  Air began feeping<span class="note">A word that other worlds would do well to borrow.
    Our world's contribution would be "phlegm",
    which it sounds exactly like the thing it describes.</span> out of the dinghy;

3.  A set of black sails crested the horizon.
    There was another *crack!*
    and a second cannonball whistled overhead
    to splash into the water nearby.

Santa Greenwood stood up,
nearly causing the others to spill into the ocean
as the dinghy rocked dangerously.
"Come on, Periwinkle, gimme something!" he roared,
hefting his ax again.
"Chili grenades! Tangle muffins! Anything!"

"I'm out!" Santa Hood,
her arm deeper in her sack than basic physics should have allowed.<span class="note">Basic physics
was actually quite uncomfortable about this,
but nobody thought to ask it.
Quantum physics would have just been, "Like, whatever, dude."</span>

"Look!" Finner shouted
as a wooden ship crested the horizon.
It was painted the same menacing black as the sails.
There was an orange flash on her deck and another *crack!*.
A third cannonball hit the water between the dinghy and the circling gray fins.

"Ya gormless nabblers!" Santa Greenwood bellowed,
shaking his ax so hard that he lost his footing.
Finner grabbed the santa's belt to stop him from falling out of the dinghy
and was nearly pulled out himself.
"Why don'tcha come here an' try that, eh?"

A fourth *crack!*, another cannonball.
The ship was close enough now that Finner could see
crew in the rigging and on the deck
shouting and waving.
"Wait! They're not shooting at us!"
Finner exclaimed.
"They're shooting at the sharks!"

"Or they just can't aim!"
Santa Hood snapped,
her arm still deep in her sack.

And then the smaller gray fin decided it was now or never
and changed course and raced toward them.
The shark the fin belonged to was a menacing dark bulk just below the surface.

Finner could feel the dinghy softening beneath his bootless foot
as Santa Greenwood tried to stand up again
and Santa Hood ducked so as not to be beheaded by the ax
he actually wasn't being very careful with.
"Got it!" she said triumphantly.
She pulled something out of her sack and threw it.

There was a loud bang.
Sea water splattered all over them.
Finner's eyes immediately began itching and streaming.
"One last ch-chili bomb," Santa Hood said.

"Ahoy!" a distant voice called as the two gray fins turned and fled.<span class="note">Or rather,
decided *quite independently of their changed circumstances*
that it was a good time to pursue other opportunities,
because sharks *never* "flee".</span>
"Might ye be in need of assistance there?"

Santa Greenwood's face fell.
"Oh, not him," he muttered.
"Anyone but him."

"Who?" Finner and Santa Hood asked simultaneously.

The black ship came up beside them.
Rope ladders were already draped over her side,
each with a sailor hanging from it with their arm out.
One, two, and *three* (Santa Greenwood being rather heavy)
and the dinghy was left empty in the ship's wake.<span class="note">The dinghy
rather appreciated having some time to itself,
what with the first few minutes of its inflated existence
being so full of new experiences.
Then it sank,
which only goes to show—something.</span>

Finner clambered up the rope ladder and on to the deck.
Given recent events,
he was completely unsurprised to find himself face-to-face with another santa.
But what a santa:
between the eyepatch,
the skull earrings,
the peg leg,
the parrot (who had a peg leg of her own)
and the very large and very sharp cutlass in his hands,
*this* was the kind of santa other santas dreamed of being.

"Well, ain't you the lucky ones?" the santa boomed,
a twinkle in his eye.
"Us happenin' along just now an' all.
Coulda been mighty dicey there, mighty dicey indeed."

"We were doin' all right," Santa Greenwood muttered sullenly.

"Aye, I could see that," the pirate santa said,
straight-faced.
"Ah, but where's me manners?
I'm Cap'n Clausbeard,
an' this is my crew."
He waved his sword to include the dozen figures
now standing around and behind the new arrivals,
all of whom just happened to have sharp pieces of metal or thuddy things<span class="note">I.e.,
things that go "thud" when they hit you.</span>
in their hands.

"This is Santa Hood,"
Santa Greenwood said reluctantly.
"And Figleaf—they're Miss Tumbly's."

"It's Finner," Finner corrected automatically.
No-one noticed.

The pause stretched awkwardly
until Santa Greenwood sighed heavily and gestured at Captain Clausbeard.
"And *this* is my dad."

## Episode 6: Some Explanations Are Finally Given

A few busy minutes later,
Finner was sitting in a slightly cramped cabin
with a thick blanket wrapped around his shoulders
and a steaming mug of something called seaweed tea in his hands.
Santa Hood was somewhere under an even larger blanket on the bunk opposite his stool,
while Santa Greenwood had solved the problem of being too big for the available furniture
by sitting on the floor.
*Deck,* Finner corrected himself.
*It's called a deck on a ship.
Which this is.*

He shook himself.
"About the whole 'saving the worlds' thing," he ventured.

Santa Greenwood swallowed a swig<span class="note">Which is what a "gulp" is called
when you're on a ship.</span> of tea
and set the mug on the deck beside his ax.
"They showed up a while back," he said,
looking at and through the wall opposite him.
"'Bout the time I was your age, actually, so maybe more than a while.
Anyway,
at first they were all talk.
Folks ought to do deliveries year round,
and they ought to deliver groceries and such as well as actual presents,
that kind of thing.
Made no sense,
but folk figured there was no harm in lettin' them talk."

"But who are 'they'?" Finner asked.

"A handful of misguided santas,"
Santa Hood's muffled voice said from under the blanket.
"People get odd notions sometimes,
especially on the worlds where there's only a few of them or even just one.
The loneliness gets to them after a while
and they go a little odd."

"Callin' it 'odd' is more polite than I'd be."
Santa Greenwood picked up his mug and scowled at its contents.
"And when sensible folk wouldn't listen to their nonsense,
they took matters into their own hands.
They started makin' *stuff*, like socks and cutlery and what-not."
His scowl deepened.
"Nothing wrong with that—everybody likes gettin' socks<span class="note">
It's amazing how many people sincerely believe this.
</span>
but they made more of it than anyone had ever seen.
And instead of puttin' it in the basement or a barn or something decent
until it was time to deliver it,
they just went and gave it right away to—to *everyone*."

"In broad daylight," Santa Hood added tiredly
as Santa Greenwood glared into his tea.
"They didn't even care if people had been naughty or nice.
They just gave things to everyone."

"And they didn't wrap 'em, either," Santa Greenwood added heatedly.
"Folk might've let them get away with it for a while
if they'd at least *wrapped* things,
but—"
He shook his head.
"It was disrespectful, is what it was."

"Mm."
Wrapping had never been Finner's favorite chore,<span class="note">Though
it was still better than writing class.</span>
but the thought of what his parents or Gran-Granna Tumbly would say
if a present went into a sack without being wrapped made his stomach do flip-flops.
"So…?"

Santa Hood pulled her blanket down enough for her head to be visible.
"Once they got going it turned out that a lot of people agreed with them—a *lot* more.
Pretty soon it wasn't just a handful of santas from backwater worlds—dozens joined in."

"Hundreds!"
Santa Greenwood grunted.

"After a while, yes,"
Santa Hood agreed.
"And just when everyone thought they couldn't do anything worse,
they let all their elves out of their basements.
Or you know, their caves or wherever."
She shrugged under her blanket.

Finner's mouth went dry
the way it always did when he thought about elves.
"What do you mean?
My parents let our elves out all the time."

Santa Hood shook her head.
"I don't mean just to run errands and get parts and what-not.
They *let them out*.
They let them just walk around wherever they wanted
and have their own houses and make more of themselves,
as many more as they wanted."
Her eyes blazed.
"Do you have any idea how dangerous that could be?
One elf makes another so now you have two.
Each of them makes another, so now there's four,
then eight, then— then—"

"Sixteen," Finner supplied helpfully.<span class="note">He
knew all the powers of two up to 4096.</span>

"Sixteen," Santa Hood agreed.
"Pretty soon there'd be more of them than us,
and then—"

"Elfageddon," Santa Greenwood finished solemnly.
"The end o' worlds.
No more presents, no more deliveries—no more anything, most like."

"But I thought you said they wanted to make deliveries all the time."
Finner protested,
then swallowed dryly at the looks the other two santas gave him.

"Just givin' people stuff ain't *deliveries*," Santa Greenwood spat.

"Giving who what?" boomed Captain Clausbeard,
who had just opened the cabin door without bothering to knock.
His parrot squawked something in his ear.
"Ah. Right. Them.
Anyway, what's it like bein' back in your old cabin, eh, lad?
Must bring back memories, eh?"

Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.<span class="note">*Purely by coincidence*
a slight shiver went down Finner's spine as she did so.</span>
"This was *your* cabin?"

Santa Greenwood growled but didn't reply.
Santa Hood jerked her chin at a pencil drawing of a tropical island
nailed up beside the cabin's single round porthole.
"I didn't know you were so artistic."

"Oh, my boy was a wizard with all that stuff,"
Captain Clausbeard said proudly.
"And even better at crochet.
Why, I still have a couple of doilies that—"

"I *think*," Santa Greenwood interrupted,
"I think we oughta focus on the problem at hand, don't you?
Namely how we're going to get Fiddler—"

"Finner."

"—back to Miz Tumbly
and how we're gonna get my llamas and elves back to *me*
and what in the name of rain we're going to do about these,
these *troublemakers*,
because I for one have had *enough*!"
He thumped his meaty fist on the deck,
making Captain Clausbeard's parrot<span class="note">The parrot
would have been somewhat offended by this phrasing,
as she thought of the captain as being hers.
Luckily for our story,
the parrot found turning pages so difficult
that it never bothered to read books.</span> squawk.

Whatever the captain might have said in reply to that
was cut off by a cry from the crow's nest.
"Smoke, cap'n!
We got smoke on the horizon!
North by nor'west,
a couple o' hundred fathoms up,
and it's headed our way!"

The humor dropped from Captain Clausbeard's face like spilled porridge.
"Well, lad, are ye fit to fight?" he asked.

"Fit enough."
Santa Greenwood clambered to his feet,
swore as his head hit the ceiling,
and picked up his ax.

Captain Clausbeard nodded.
"Glad t' hear it.
Your friends can stay here 'til we know whether we're eatin' peaches or pickles.
That's an order," he added as Santa Hood opened her mouth.

"Yes cap'n," she said neutrally.

Captain Clausbeard raised an eyebrow<span class="note">Which,
funnily enough,
didn't send a shiver down Finner's spine.</span>
but said nothing before stomping out,
his peg leg thumping on the deck.
"Avast, ye scallywags!" he bellowed.
The door closed behind him.

Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.
"Don't worry about us,"
Santa Hood said perkily,
wriggling a bit to free herself from her blanket's embrace.
"We'll be safe in here.
Besides, I'm not done studying this masterpiece of yours."

Finner expected Santa Greenwood to scowl or make a joke.
Instead, he spoke quietly, without looking at either of them.
"That's Isla del Tesoro.
It was my first forest.
More of a jungle, really,
but there were trees big as masts with these great beards o' moss hangin' off them.
The rest o' the crew didn't like it—they all got itchy
as soon as they were out of earshot o' the waves,
but you could walk for hours an' see nothin' that wasn't green.
First time I spent the night there felt like comin' home.
Drawin' that picture felt like makin' myself a promise.
Kinda surprised my dad left it up,
what with all the arguin' we did when I told him I was leavin'."

For a long moment the only sounds were the creaking of the ship's timbers
and muffled shouts from the crew.
"We'll be safe in here,"
Santa Hood repeated,
her tone as soft as Santa Greenwood's had been.

Santa Greenwood nodded,
yanked the door open,
swore as his forehead hit the lintel,
and closed the door behind him.
Santa Hood rolled her head to work out a kind in her neck.
"So," she said conversationally,
letting the blanket slide down so that Finner could see
the raygun she was holding,
which just happened to be aimed at his chest.
"How about you tell me who you really are?"

</section>

<section markdown="1">

## Episode 7: An Airborne Attack Occurs

Finner's hands put themselves up.<span class="note">
Whic is more accurate than saying "he raised his hands"
because his brain wasn't really involved in the process.
</span>
"I'm Finner!" he exclaimed.
"Finner Tumbly!"

"Uh huh.
And I suppose you want me to believe that
you just *happened* to be in sensei's house when those elves attacked?"

Finner's mouth worked.
"I didn't know they were going to attack!" he finally managed to get out.
"I didn't know about, about chimneys to other worlds,
I don't know why you call my gran-granna 'sensei'—I don't know anything
about *any* of this!
I just want to go *home*."

Santa Hood studied his face for a moment,
then flipped the raygun over and offered it to him.
"Doesn't work unless you're an elf," she explained.

"Then why were you pointing it at me!?"

The corner of Santa Hood's mouth quirked up.
"Would you feel better about that if I *had* been able to shoot you with it?
Here, take it."
She leaned forward to pass it to him and winced.

Finner put it on the tiny desk he'd been sitting on.
"How are your ribs?" he asked sulkily.

Santa Hood shook her head.
"I've had worse.
You don't learn to make the kinds of presents I make
without getting a few bumps and bruises.
Your gran-granna taught me that.
That's why I call her 'sensei'," she added.
"When all this trouble started
she was one of the first santas to say we had to do more than just talk.
She started teaching people how to fight."

Finner would have said, "I don't believe it,"
except he did.
The stone cat in Gran-Granna's front yard,
her magic sword—even without all of that,
the idea that she had been some sort of soldier or ninja or whatever
was perfectly in character.
He still had questions,
but what he said was,
"Can I get you anything for your ribs?"

Santa Hood snorted, which made her wince again.
"Some tea would be nice,
but I think we'd both better stay down here for now.
I'm going to try to get some sleep—wake me up
if anything exciting happens?"

A few moments later she was snoring gently beneath her pile of blankets.
Finner put his head down on the little desk and tried to fall asleep as well,
but the rock and sway of the ship made his stomach flip-flop
every time he closed his eyes.
Finally he sat up,
rolled his head from side to side to get a kink out of his neck,
and picked up the raygun Santa Hood had given him.

It looked like a well-made toy with its gnurled grip and shiny barrel,
but was heavy in a way that said,
"No, I can actually make holes in things."
He pointed it at the porthole,
closed one eye,
and said, "Blam!"

A brilliant green beam of light blasted the glass right out of the porthole.
Finner gaped,
still feeling the hum of the shot in his hand,
then tossed the raygun onto the desk as if it had just bitten him.

"Wuzza?" Santa Hood grunted in her sleep.
Finner held his breath until she rolled over under blankets
and started snoring again.
The ray run just lay there the whole time
like an unopened note for his parents from his writing teacher.<span class="note">
The first time Finner had to bring home a note from that teacher,
his parents let it sit on the dinner table *until dinner* before opening it.
They didn't mention it or even look at it,
which of course meant Finner couldn't think about anything else.
It turned out to be a reminder about an overdue book addressed to another student,
which left Finner feeling somehow cheated out of a calamity.
</span>

"Right," Finner muttered under his breath.
He picked up the ray run gingerly,
holding it with just his thumb and one finger,
and twisted it around to study it.
There were no buttons that he could see,
especially not one labeled "turn on for santas",
but the porthole was still definitely glassless.
Santa Hood must have been wrong about it only working for elves.

He brightened slightly.
Maybe it only worked for teenagers.
Maybe instead of just being baggage<span class="note">
A term used only occasionally by Gran-Granna Tumbly
that always provoked a mix of shock, dismay, and grudging admissions that yes,
so-and-so *did* seem like the sort of person who would bring a store-bought sweater
as a baby gift instead of something hand-made.
</span>
he could actually help Santa Hood
(and Santa Greenwood too, of course).
For a moment he saw himself standing beside them,
blasting away with the raygun while his new-found teammates tossed their grenades
and waved their ax menacingly.
Maybe he could even—

*Crack!*
*Crack!*
The whole ship shuddered beneath his feet as the cannons above him fired.
Shouts rang on the deck outside the cabin.
"Wuzza!?" Santa Hood grunted again, sitting up.
"Wuz g'non?"

"Stay here," Finner said firmly.
He tucked the ray run into his trousers,
then imagined what would happen if it went off again
and transferred it to his pocket.<span class="note">
Which admittedly wouldn't be all that much safer
if there was what his writing teacher would probably have referred to as
"an unfortunate incident".
</span>
"I'll be right back," he promised
as he pulled the cabin door open
and stepped out into chaos.

Half a dozen sailors were firing rifles and crossbows into the air.
Half a dozen others were reloading the ship's two cannons
as Captain Clausbeard and his parrot<span class="note">
Sorry, sorry—the parrot that usually chose to spend time with the captai.n
</span>
bellowed orders.
In between them,
Santa Greenbeard was hacking at an enormous black tentacle with his ax.
No, not a tentacle—it was a metal cable as thick as Finner's arm,
and it hung down from the blue-and-gray zeppelin that was right above the ship.

A second cable fell from the zeppelin as Finner gaped up into the sky,
and then a third.
The sailors' bullets and arrows had no more effect on the zeppelin
than Santa Greenwood's ax had on the cable.
"Stand by to repel boarders, ye grumble-fisted knucklewaddlers!"
Captain Clausbeard shouted,
drawing his cutlass and passing a tiny replica of it to the parrot,
who clutched the sliver-sized blade in its beak.

*Crack!*
*Crack!*
The cannons fired again.
Something thunked into the deck a few steps away from Finner
and began spewing smoke.
The cable snagged on a hatch and went taut.
*Snap!*
Finner ducked as half of the hatch flew through the air
and splashed into the ocean.

Someone yelled,
"Here they come, cap'n!"
as half a dozen elves slid down the cable,
letting go just as they reached the height of the mast.
*Thump!* *Thump!* *Thump!*
The first three hit the deck,
tumbled head over heels,
and rolled to their feet with swords in their hands.

Finner only half-noticed the others catch themselves
in the ship's rigging—he was too busy scrambling backward to get away
from the swordfight that had erupted around him
to do any more than that.
Steel rang against steel.
Captain Clausbeard and his crew pressed hard against the elves,
their blades flashing.
For a moment it looked like the attack would be over as soon as it had begun,
but more elves kept coming,
and more after them.

"Away wi' ye!" Santa Greenbeard bellowed.
With one might swing of his ax
he sent two of the elves flying over the gunwale<span class="note">
Which made the sharks very, very happy.
</span>.
His backswing snapped another elf's sword in half.
He raised the ax over his head,
took aim—

—and froze as a dart the length of Finner's thumb
suddenly sprouted from the side of his neck.
"Oh drat," he said weakly.
The ax slid out of his hands.
He fell to one knee, then both,
his hand reaching for the dart as his eyes unfocused.

Finner spun around.
A single elf dressed in black hung in the rigging of the foresail,
a blowgun in its hand.
The elf caught Finner's eye and grinned
as it pulled another dart from the pouch on its belt
and put it between its teeth.
It raised the blowgun to its lips and took aim.

Afterward,
Finner could never remember actually drawing the raygun.
It was just suddenly there in his hand.
A single brilliant bolt of green punched a smoldering hole in the foresail
just a few inches from the elf's head.
"Bwah!?" the elf tried to say,
then, "Uh oh."
It glared accusingly at Finner,
spat out the dart it had just swallowed,
and sagged in the rigging like a straw doll
hanging forgotten in a tired child's hand.

Finner didn't give himself time to think.
He spun around and fired again and again.
His shots went wild,
but all of a sudden it was no longer
just a battle between the elves and the pirates.
It was a battle between the elves and the pirates and *him*,
and the elves hadn't counted on that.

"Their ship!
Blast their blasted ship, boy!"
Captain Clausbeard shouted.
Finner squinted,
pointed the raygun into the air,
and pulled the trigger
just as the deck swayed beneath him.
He took aim again,
flexing his knees in time with the ship's roll and heave,
and—

"Oh."
His hand flew to his neck.
There was something there.
There was—wait,
did he have a gym sock in his mouth?
It sure tasted like he did.
He turned his head sloooowly
and blinked at a second black-clad elf holding a blowgun,
and then everything went away,
including him.

## Episode 8: Shelves Full of Arms and Legs

When Finner was next aware of his own existence,
his head was several feet away from his body.
At least,
that's how he felt until he blinked,
squelched the panic rising in his throat,
and opened his eyes again to discover that
he was in fact lying on a padded table of some kind
in what looked like an operating room.
His mouth no longer tasted like a gym sock<span class="note">
The particular sock he was thinking of had belonged to a classmate of his
whose idea of "funny" was sneaking up behind people
and stuffing a sock or a mitten in their mouth.
He was eventually eaten by a crocodile while trying to win an ill-considered dare.
Nobody really missed him except his parents,
and even they were secretly a little relieved.
</span>,
but his tongue still seemed a size larger than usual,
and the straps around his wrists and ankles
were just a little too tight to be comfortable.

His brain paused and reversed
like a driver noticing an overlooked parking spot.
Why was he strapped down?
More importantly,
why was he strapped down in what looked like an operating room?
Half a dozen possible explanations raced through his mind,
each less comforting than the last.

He was about to call for help when the door opposite his feet slid open.
An elf wearing a white lab coat and a matching white mask stepped into the room,
exclaimed,
"You're awake!"
and fled,
closing the door again behind themself
without waiting for Finner to confirm or deny the observation.

"Hello?" he said.
"Could someone please—um, could someone please let me up?
I think I need to go to the bathroom."

The door slid open again.
The elf who entered this time was taller than the first one
and wore a blue and white uniform instead of a lab coat.
The ray gun in her hand was a twin of the one Finner had fired,
except hers had several tally marks scratched on the barrel
and was pointed at Finner.

"All right," she scowled,
"You have thirty seconds to convince me that we shouldn't just pitch you over the side,
so start talking."

"I—"
*I just want to go home,* he finished in his head,
but what he said was,
"I really do need to use the bathroom.
Please."

The elf scowled at her a moment longer,
then turned her head slightly.
"Gamma Three!" she called without taking her eyes off Finner.
She held the ray gun steady as the smaller elf came in
and unbuckled the straps holding Finner down.

He sat up and rubbed his wrists<span class="note">
They didn't hurt—he just thought you were supposed to do after being strapped down.
</span>.
The elf waggled her ray gun toward the door.
"Out and to the right," she said curtly.
"And don't try anything funny."<span class="note">
She probably didn't mean, "Don't try stuffing a sock in my mouth,"
but we'll never know.
</span>

"To the right" was a narrow corridor with painted metal walls
and a rubberized floor.
Flat strips set into the ceiling cast orange light
on doors like the one that slid closed behind them,
each with a number and a cryptic legend like "Aux. Battery" stenciled on it.
"One eighty one," the elf told Finner.
He fumbled with the door's handle for a moment before figuring out that
he needed to turn it clockwise,
then sighed with relief at the sight of a perfectly normal toilet and sink.

"I'll be right here," the elf warned
as she leaned back against the opposite wall and crossed her arms.
Finner nodded and slid the door shut.

*I've been telling this story more or less as it happened
because that's what books are supposed to do.
I haven't bothered with details
like the precise color of Santa Hotep's couch (dusty rose)
or the number of sails on Captain Clausbeard's ship (seven)
because they didn't seem important.
The two and a half minutes that Finner spent in the bathroom matter even less,
so let's just skip ahead to the moment after he washed his hands.*

Finner fumbled with the door handle again and then slid the door open.
The elf hadn't moved,
and neither had her scowl,
but her ray gun was holstered on her hip instead of in her hand.
"Let's go," she ordered,
nodding to show the way.
"And no funny busi—damn, why do they always run?"
Because of course that's what Finner did.

The floor rang metallically under his boots as he pelted down the corridor.
The first door he tried was locked.
So was the second<sup class="note">
Which is why he never got to find out what "BCB RNV" meant,
or why there was a hand-lettered note below the title
reminding readers to make sure their next-of-kin form was up to date
before entering.
</sup>,
but the handle of the third turned and clicked.
He slid the door out of his way,
ducked in,
and pulled the door closed again as quietly as he could.

The room was completely dark.
Finner patted the wall next to the door
until he found a switch,
then hesitated.
It might be a light,
but it might also—he wasn't quite sure what,
but given how things had been doing,
"set off an alarm" and "open a trap door" both seemed possible.
Instead,
he pressed his ear gingerly to the door
and listened for sounds of pursuit.
There was nothing,
nothing except his own breathing
and the deep *thrum thrum thrum* of something large and mechanical.

He turned,
put his back against the door,
and slid down to the floor.
"Well," he said,
and then he had to hug his knees and press his face into them
so that he wouldn't start crying.
He had no idea where he was,
but he was pretty sure these were the elves who had attacked Gran-Granna Tumbly's
and chased him and the two santas from one universe to another
and he was glad he'd had a chance to go to the bathroom
but he was *hungry*
and he just wanted to go home and be miserable there.

The moment passed,
as such moments always do.
He wiped his face on his trousers,
got to his feet,
and flipped the switch by the door<span class="note">
Much harder than he needed to from a mechanical point of view,
but exactly hard enough emotionally.
</span>.

It was, in fact, just the lights.
Four strips in the ceiling came to life,
casting the same orange light as the ones in the corridor.
Instead of numbered doors,
though,
these ones showed Finner a scene straight out of a nightmare.

The room was the same size as the one he had woken up in.
Instead of a padded table it had floor-to-ceiling shelves
stacked with arms, legs, heads, and clear plastic boxes full of bones and gears.
Every shelf was neatly labelled and everything was tidy,
but somehow that was more frightening than helter-skelter piles would have been.

*Mannequins,* he thought wildly.
*Robots. Props for the theater.*
Because of course they couldn't actually be—be what they looked like.

Swallowing hard,
he stepped forward and poked the nearest leg with his finger.
It yielded slightly,
just like the real thing,
but it didn't twitch and the toes didn't wiggle
so at least there was that.

He was just about to poke it again when the door slid open behind him.
Grabbing it by the ankle and raising it like a club,
he whirled around.
"Keep back!" he warned,
shifting his grip a moment later to get the thigh out of his face<span class="note">
If you ever pick up a leg to wave at someone,
please remember that it has a knee.
</span>.

The elf he had run away from looked at him with just a touch of pity in her eyes.
"How about you put that back and come with me?"
she suggested.

Thirty seconds,
three corners,
and a dozen closed doors later,
the corridor brought them to a ladder with eight brass rungs
that had been polished to silver in patches by use.
Finner clambered up into the murmur and bustle of
the bridge of a zeppelin in flight.
The front wall was made of hexagonal glass panels
held together by thin strips of brass.
The walls to either side were filled with instruments, controls, relays,
and framed photographs of other airships.
A pair of elves in blute and white uniforms paced back and forth beside them,
adjusting dials and jotting notes on clipboards.
Another uniformed elf stood facing the enormous window
with their hands clasped behind their back.
Their straight back and the cutlass at their side practically shouted "in charge".

"Alpha Two reporting with salvage in tow,"
the elf behind Finner reported crisply.

"Thank you," the other elf said without turning.
"Did the Gammas find anything beyond the usual?"

"No, captain," Alpha Two replied.

The captain nodded.
"Dismissed."

Alpha Two hesitated.
"Sir—"

"I'm sure it will be all right, Alpha Two,"
the captain said smoothly.
"If he was going to explode, he would have done so by now."

Alpha Two saluted.
"Yes sir."
She grabbed hold of the ladder posts and slid down into the corridor below,
pausing only to give Finner one last scowl
that could have stripped the varnish off an old bench.

Finner waited for the captain to say something.
The moment stretched and stretched until he couldn't bear it any longer.
"Um, excuse me," he started,
then stopped in shock as the captain put their hand on the hilt of their cutlass
and turned around.

It was Gran-Granna Tumbly.

## Episode 9: Emerg. Chimney

People sometimes say, "Their jaw dropped,"
but that's not what actually happens,
at least not most of the time.
What *usually* happens is that your mouth opens and closes a few times
because your brain knows you're supposed to say something like,
"What are you doing here?"
but can't find the right words—or even the wrong ones.
It's as if something was stuck in the elevator doors of your mind
and making it go *ding! ding! ding!* over and over again.

The zeppelin's captain waited patiently for Finner's doors to close.
The other elves glanced at him occasionally but didn't interfere:
keeping an airship flying is tricky even in the best of circumstances,
and if Finner had been paying attention
he would have heard quiet murmurs about damage control crews reporting in
and steering vanes needing in-flight repairs.
The skirmish with Captain Clausbeard's ship had only been
the equivalent of two cats taking swipes at one another
and then pretending each other didn't exist,
but zeppelins are fragile things.

"Gran-Granna?" Finner finally managed.
Even as he said it he belatedly realized that the elf wasn't his great-grandmother.
They were too tall and didn't have nearly enough wrinkles on their face<span class="note">
Old people don't actually have more wrinkles than young ones.
The real difference is that young people's skin hasn't had enough practice wrinkling
to do it all the time.
By the time you have smiled or frowned as often as someone like Gran-Granna Tumbly,
your wrinkles are like a weight lifter's biceps.
Some cultures regard strongly-defined wrinkles as a sign of virtue,
and have specialized gyms where people wiggle their eyebrows to music
or smirk over and over again
while a personal trainer urges them on.
</span>.
Plus,
even if the jingly bells on their hat were stuffed with yarn to muffle them,
they were clearly an elf,
not a santa.

"Captain Alpha One, actually," the elf said in a clipped voice.
"And you must be Finbar."

"It's Finner,"
Finner corrected automatically.

"Finner," the captain repeated.
"I'll keep that in mind.
So,
what were you doing on board the *Dancing Marmot*
and how did you come by this?"
They held up a familiar ray gun,
then tucked it back in one of the voluminous pockets of their overcoat.

"Um."
Finner cleared his throat.
"If the *Dancing Marmot* is the ship I was just on,
they rescued us from sharks because our rubber dinghy was sinking.
And I got that from one of the santas I was with.
I think she got it from one of the elves who was shooting at us
when we were—um,
well,
there was this pyramid,
and,
um,
look,
I'm sorry I shot at your zeppelin.
I didn't know it would actually work.
I hope I didn't hurt anyone,"
he added belatedly,
suddenly remembering the glass that wasn't in the porthole of Santa Greenwood's old cabin any longer.

"Number two stabilizer is back in action, captain,"
an elf called out from a control panel to Finner's left.

"Thank you, Alpha Nine,"
the captain said without taking their eyes off Finner's face.
"Have the crew start work on the vents next."

"Aye aye, captain."

The captain studied Finner a moment longer,
then sighed.
"Well,
we don't really need more crew,
but I don't imagine Command would take kindly to us
throwing you over the side.
One of the Beta watch will find something for you to do until we're docked.
The Rescue Committee can decide how best to help you then."
They nodded sharply in dismissal and turned back around.

Finner stood there a moment,
feeling even more foolish than he had before,
then cleared his throat.
"Yes?"
the captain said without looking.

"I'm sorry,"
Finner said.
"I really am,
but who are the Rescue Committee and why would they help me?
I really do just want to get home."

"The Committee is responsible for all elves rescued from bondage and servitude,
and for those who escape on their own.
Even those who do so accidentally,"
they added pointedly.

"But—but I'm not an elf," Finner protested.
"I mean,
I know I don't have much of a beard yet,
but—"

"If you're not an elf,
how were you able to fire the Zap-50?"
The captain patted the pocket holding the ray gun.

"I don't know,"
Finner said,
immediately angry at himself for the whiny tone in his voice.
"But I'm definitely not an elf—just ask my parents.
Or my gran-granna,"
he added boldly,
"Since you look so much like her."

He practically felt the elves on the bridge not looking his way
as the captain turned around and looked at Finner
with absolutely no expression<span class="note">
In the sense of "absolute zero".
</span>.
"Alpha Seven," they said neutrally.

One of the elves straightened.
"Yes, captain."

"Remove him from the bridge.
Find someone from Beta watch who has annoyed me recently
and tell them to keep him busy."

"Yes, captain."
The elf saluted,
then stepped forward and put their hand on Finner's elbow.

"I can get down the ladder on my own, thank you,"
Finner snapped,
shaking off the elf's hand.
He stalked back to the ladder like an angry house cat,
briefly considered trying to slide down the posts the way Alpha Two had,
imagined how humiliated he'd feel if he fell or sprained his ankle,
and climbed down the rungs instead,
making far more noise than he needed to.

Alpha Seven used the rungs as well,
though far more quietly.
"Second left then a right,"
they told Finner,
pointing down the corridor.

Finner did a double take.
The hand the elf had pointed with looked like it was carved out of wood,
and had joints like a marionette's.
And their face—at first it was just the same dark brown as Finner's,
but then the elf frowned and Finner saw a faint wood grain.

"What are *you* looking at?" the elf asked sharply.

"I—sorry, I din't mean to… Um…"

The elf's frown deepened.
"Let me give you some advice," they said
in a tone that made it clear that what they meant was "a warning".
"Just because you're still in your original body doesn't make you special,
not on this ship.
The captain doesn't tolerate any 'real boy' nonsense
and neither do the rest of us.
Got it?"

"Got it! I got it!"
Finner raised his hands in apology.

He was just about to start walking again when an alarm began to blare:
*murrrp murrrp*, pause, *murrrp murrrp*, pause.
The overhead lights changed from orange to red.
"All hands, all hands, battle stations!"
a crackly voice ordered through unseen speakers.
"Battery teams to firing stations!
Fire suppression teams, suit up!
This is not a drill!"

"Look!" Finner shouted, pointing back the way they had come.
Alpha Seven spun around,
and in the moment it took the elf to realize they'd been tricked,
Finner ran.

*I'm getting pretty good at this,* he thought giddily
as he half-slid, half-bounced around a corner.
There!
Door number one oh six, "Emerg. Chimney".
He twisted the handle,
pulled it aside,
stubbed his toe on the sill as he stepped through,
and slid the door shut behind him.
*Snick!*
He hoped that was a lock.
Even more,
he hoped he wouldn't be here long enough to find out if he was right.

The room was even smaller than the one he'd woken up in.
There was no furniture and no window,
just a line drawing of a chimney on one whitewashed wall
with a pair of heavy brass dials beside it.
Half a dozen three-letter codes were stencilled on the wall beside it
with a pair of number next to each:
"QCD 143.7 22.8",
"NAR 96.0 533.5"…
The last code was "OVB".
The numbers had been crossed out
and the words "We miss you Number Five" hand-written in their place.

"Hey!"
A heavy fist banged on the door.
"Open up!
Open up *now*!"

"Just a miiinuuute,"
Finner sang.
The codes had to stand for places,
and the numbers had to be how to set the dials to get to them,
but how was he supposed to know where "QCD" or "NAR" were
or whether they were safe to go to,
because he was pretty sure "OVB" wasn't.

"Last chance!" Alpha Seven bellowed.
"Either you open this door or I zap it open!"

Finner said a word he was pretty sure his parents thought
he still didn't know<span class="note">
Though he had heard them both use it while playing dominoes.
Drawing the double twelve late in the game
when all the other twelves are already on the table
often brings out the worst in people.
</span>.
If he went to any of the places marked on the wall
he'd practically be throwing himself into the arms
of some other bunch of elves.
On the other hand,
if he picked a destination at random,
he could wind up on the moon without a spacesuit
or sitting on an ice floe wondering if the cold or Santa Kraken
would get to him first.

His shoulders slumped.
Better to be a prisoner than a meal.
"All right, I give up," he said,
or would have if a loud *boom!* hadn't shaken the zeppelin
hard enough to knock Finner right off his feet.
The whole room—in fact, the whole zeppelin—tilted to one side.

As Finner fell forward
his left hand hit one of the dials.
The light above his head flashed,
or maybe that just a side effect of him stretching in one impossible direction
while the universe stretched around him in another.

A moment later the lock sizzled and evaporated.
Alpha Seven slid the door open,
looked despondently at the empty room,
and used exactly the same word Finner had used moments before.

## Episode 10: Santasaurus Rex

You have probably been cold at some point in your life.
Maybe you wriggled out from under your blanket as a baby on a chilly night
and weren't yet able to wriggle back underneath it.
Maybe you didn't realize that someone else in the house liked cold showers
and turned on the water *while you were already standing underneath the showerhead*
and were blasted with the last few seconds of that previous person's liquid self-loathing.
Or perhaps you have had to endure the kind of bone-deep chill of being poor in winter,
of not being able to afford to turn up the heat during the day
or to buy a coat that's thick enough to keep out the wind.
That kind of cold is the worst:
it seeps into your soul as well as your body
because you lose hope of it ever ending.

Thirty seconds after whumping<span class="note">
Another word that sounds exactly like the thing it describes.
</span>
into a snowbank somewhere very Arctic,
Finner felt even colder than that.
The sky above him was an impossibly clear blue
and the sun was so bright he couldn't even look *near* it,
but each time he took a breath
he could feel the air going into every little corner of his lungs.
Tiny icicles had formed in his nostrils,
and his beard crackled each time he squinted.

The snow squeaked beneath his boots with every step.
Basic survival training is part of every santa's education,
and Finner knew that if he just stood still and shivered,
he wouldn't shiver for long.
He had no idea where he was going,
or even if there was a "where" to go to,
but he had to keep moving.

He struggled up to the top of yet another shallow ridge
and rubbed his eyes with fingers he could no longer feel properly.
Were there icicles in his eyelashes?
That wasn't important.
What mattered was that the sunlight was reflecting off something up ahead.
Glass, metal, it didn't matter:
as long as it wasn't ice,
it was something to aim for.
He stumbled toward it,
hugging himself to keep in what little body heat he had left.

When he reached the top of the next ridge
he had to stop and rub his eyes again.
An enormous factory sat in the shallow valley in front of him.
It was bigger than any building Finner had ever seen—he
could have stacked ten copies of his school on top of one another
and still not reached its steeply-slanted roof.
Turrets and towers,
windows of all shapes and sizes,
and—

A chill ran up his spine.
A flying saucer was moored against the side of the factory,
bobbing gently up and down in the Arctic breeze.
It was almost as large as the zeppelin he had so recently escaped from,
and its silver underbelly was scratched and scraped from heavy use.

"It's not exactly traditional,"
a helpful voice said behind him.
"But the poor reindeer simply couldn't carry the load any longer."

Finner turned around slowly.
The person smiling at him was wearing a carefully-patched red coat and a tasselled hat.
Their steel body and cheery painted face
had fewer scratches and scrapes than the flying saucer,
but they were clearly not fresh out of their box.

"Whoops," the elf said,
tucking the ray gun that Finner was staring at
back into its holster.
"Old habit.
Used to be quite strict around here about security.
Some folks would rather not wait for their presents,
if you take my meaning."
One red electric eye blinked on and off in a wink.
"Now, I presume you'd be wanting somewhere warm to sit and a nice cup of tea, eh?"

The hike from the ridge to the factory only took a few minutes,
but as Finner's brain slowly retreated from reality
it seemed to last forever.
First he couldn't feel his toes,
but that had happened before when he had gone out to play in the snow
in his running shoes.
Then his feet went numb,
which made him feel like he was walking on two small sandbags<span class="note">
Yes, it really does feel like that.
</span>.
His ears hurt, then stopped hurting;
his eyelids started sticking together every time he blinked,
and his fingers might as well have been the little breakfast sausages that his father was so fond of.
*I wonder if someone will tell them?*
he thought blearily,
nodding (or trying to nod) at whatever the elf was saying.

A hand on his arm stopped him.
"We're here," the elf repeated gently.
Finner wiped his eyes with his sleeve.
There was a door in front of him,
a perfectly normal door with a little peaked roof over it.
The elf opened it and waved him through.

The mud room on the other side had a boot rack,
a couple of stools,
some hooks for hanging coats (all empty),
and a little electric heater
whose cheery orange coils were the most beautiful thing Finner had ever seen.
He stood so close that he could smell the wool of his jacket warming up,
but he didn't care.
He didn't care if it caught fire.

"Here," the elf said,
nudging a stool underneath him.
"I'll see if I can find some tea.
You do drink tea, don't you?"

"Yuh-yuh-yuh-"

The elf patted his shoulder.
"I'll be right back."

Finner vaguely noticed the elf open the mud room's other door.
The icicles in his nose and beard and eyebrows were melting.
He wiped his face with his sleeve again
and then tried flexing his fingers.
They still felt like rubbery sausages,
but when he rubbed his hands together
there was at least a little bit of feeling.

He was just about to pull off one of his boots
to see if his feet were still there
when the inner door opened again.
The elf who had saved him from freezing to death returned
with a large cup of tea in their hand
and a small dinosaur wearing a parka and a knit cap behind them.
