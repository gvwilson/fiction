## Chapter 1

Iffy had a bad dream that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn't really a dream.

She was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
a hand-me-down ecosuit that had cost as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
"Just t' be safe, love," Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family's youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped Iffy's favorite bedtime book inside the bulky orange suit.
"Just in case."

The ship's horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of bed just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.

Third hugged her again.
"Enough o' that!" Second snapped.
At the time Iffy thought the older clone was angry at her for something she had done.
Years later she realized Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen
and at herself for not being able to stop it.

"She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.
"Two hundred meters ahead an' ten points off starboard!"

Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"I love you always an' forever."

"I love you too," Iffy replied tearfully.
She tried to return Third's hug,
but the thick insulation in the suit made it hard to bend her arms.

Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she always used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterwardâ€”that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a million tiny bubbles trapped in ancient clathrate ice were about to burst free.

The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer the *Rushin Doll* out of the mass of foam boiling up around them.
"She's boilin'! She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time.
Third closed the ecosuit's faceplate and mouthed "I love you" one last time.

The ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Iffy screamed as she tumbled onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
Ice-cold sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as the slosh dragged her and her olders against the taffrail.
Her olders grabbed for it,
but the ship dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor
churned the water into a froth too thin to hold the boat afloat.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth falling from the crow's nest,
her arms and legs flailing against the perfect blue sky.

The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.

Her dream stopped then,
just like always.
She didn't remember the sea snapping the *Rushin Doll*'s keel.
She didn't remember being hauled out of the sea in a jelly dredging net hours later,
or standing on the deck of the *Guinevere* for the first time.
But she remembered how blue the sky was,
and how it had felt to be alone for the first time in her life.

The woman she came to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle Iffy had survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she wound up staying on the *Guinevere*.
Her captain,
Uncle Jack,
didn't like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners or the governor
or the co-ops that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie dredged out of the Weddell Sea
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn't have the decency to look at him at all.
He would have dropped her on the pier and sailed away.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn't.
They wouldn't have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?

So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack had two pairs that night,
eights over fives,
but the Aussie across the table had three sixes.
"You were gonna outgrow it anyway,"
he snapped over her tearful protests when she found out it was gone.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow."

He would have gambled away the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn't misplaced it until he forgot about it.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy's age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people made books out of paper
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy re-read it every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her app when she was bored by school,
and on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her,
she took out the book and told them all about *orcinus orca* and *panthera tigris*
and her favorite, *giraffa camelopardalis*.

"They were too real!" she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed any doubts.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as the handwritten comments in the book's margins that she spent hours deciphering.
Real as being poor and lonely
as she grew older
and Uncle Jack's business deals left them with a little less each season.
