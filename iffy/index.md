## Chapter 1

<span id="2024-02-15-a"></span>

Iffy had a bad dream that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn't really a dream.

She was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
a hand-me-down ecosuit that had cost as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
"Just t' be safe, love," Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family's youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped Iffy's favorite bedtime book inside the bulky orange suit.
"Just in case."

The ship's horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of bed just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.

Third hugged her again.
"Enough o' that!" Second snapped.
At the time Iffy thought the older clone was angry at her for something she had done.
Years later she realized Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen
and at herself for not being able to stop it.

"She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.
"Two hundred meters ahead an' ten points off starboard!"

Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"I love you always an' forever."

"I love you too," Iffy replied tearfully.
She tried to return Third's hug,
but the thick insulation in the suit made it hard to bend her arms.

Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she always used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterward—that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a million tiny bubbles trapped in ancient clathrate ice were about to burst free.

The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer the *Rushin Doll* out of the mass of foam boiling up around them.
"She's boilin'! She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time.
Third closed the ecosuit's faceplate and mouthed "I love you" one last time.

The ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Iffy screamed as she tumbled onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
Ice-cold sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as the slosh dragged her and her olders against the taffrail.
Her olders grabbed for it,
but the ship dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor
churned the water into a froth too thin to hold the boat afloat.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth falling from the crow's nest,
her arms and legs flailing against the perfect blue sky.

The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.

Her dream stopped then,
just like always.
She didn't remember the sea snapping the *Rushin Doll*'s keel.
She didn't remember being hauled out of the sea in a jelly dredging net hours later,
or standing on the deck of the *Guinevere* for the first time.
But she remembered how blue the sky was,
and how it had felt to be alone for the first time in her life.

The woman she came to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle Iffy had survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she wound up staying on the *Guinevere*.
Her captain,
Uncle Jack,
didn't like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners or the governor
or the co-ops that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie dredged out of the Weddell Sea
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn't have the decency to look at him at all.
He would have dropped her on the pier and sailed away.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn't.
They wouldn't have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?

So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack had two pairs that night,
eights over fives,
but the Aussie across the table had three sixes.
"You were gonna outgrow it anyway,"
he snapped over her tearful protests when she found out it was gone.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow."

He would have gambled away the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn't misplaced it until he forgot about it.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy's age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people made books out of paper
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy re-read it every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her app when she was bored by school,
and on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her,
she took out the book and told them all about *orcinus orca* and *panthera tigris*
and her favorite, *giraffa camelopardalis*.

"They were too real!" she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed any doubts.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as the handwritten comments in the book's margins that she spent hours deciphering.
Real as being poor and lonely
as she grew older
and Uncle Jack's business deals left them with a little less each season.

<span id="2024-02-16-a"></span>

Iffy woke that morning to the sound of Aunt Naggie bustling about in the galley.
She lay on the narrow foam packing slab she used as a mattress for one final precious moment
before slithering out of her salvaged sleeping bag
and pulling a layer of clothes over her thermals.
The noise was her foster mother's way of telling her that Uncle Jack was awake
and that she should be up on deck doing something useful
before he stumbled out into the light looking for someone to yell at.

She closed her eyes and opened her nature book at random.
It was ridiculous—Jeep had made fun of her for a month
when he found out—but…

"Figures," she muttered when she opened her eyes.
The armadillo wasn't the most ridiculous animal in the book,
but it wasn't her favorite.
Still,
an armadillo day was better than a blobfish day.
She tucked the book back under her mattress,
yawned,
rubbed the stubble on her scalp,
and undogged the door of the storage locker
that had been her bedroom for the past eight years.

Stepping onto the deck of the *Guinevere* was like being born:
everything was suddenly bright and cold and loud and smelly and amazing.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the light.
To seaward lay the broken hulk of a carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to create a seawall for the town's harbor.
Dozens of ships, large and small, bobbed up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years like the *Guinevere* to stay seaworthy.
Others were newer:
broad-beamed cargo haulers flying the Aussie stars
or sleek Zillion-built clippers with bright kite sails furled around triple masts.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about that nobody threw away anything worth eating any more.

The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Once upon a time,
Halley had been a research station where scientists studied the early signs of the Melt.
As the ice disappeared and life back home became desperate
they converted their labs into temporary houses.
By the time their children were grown they had stopped doing research
or calling the houses "temporary".

Two thousand people now made Halley their home under the governors' watchful eyes.
During the summer blooms they dredged jellyfish out of the sea
to render down for fuel and fertilizer.
When winter came they tended the town's precious greenhouses
or sailed north to Patagonia or Tasmania
to find work that would get them through the long dark.

Iffy shaded her eyes against the razor-edged sun.
A cluster of buildings was taking shape by the new pier on the edge of town.
Two were just bunkhouses,
but the third—the one Iffy had watched go up like a hungry gull waiting for scraps—was a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equipment had already been carted through its double-wide doors:
forges, presses,
a lathe with a spindle thicker than Iffy's leg,
and the prize of them all,
a printer from Nova Zembla at the opposite end of the earth.

It had arrived in the hold of a heavily-armed Aussie destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when the warship came into harbor,
railguns bristling and drones darting back and forth above her.
They lined the streets and cheered
as the destroyer's crew and a squad of Marines escorted the boxy machine through Halley's streets
to the town's quarantine shed.
Once Halley's core finished its months-long check for malware,
the only limit to what the printer could make
would be the plans and raw materials people could give it.

Iffy had seen some of those plans glowing softly on apps in Halley's three cafés.
She had taken surreptitious notes on her app instead of doing homework
while mechanics and engineers and core techs argued about weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients,
then spent hours looking up words she didn't know and figuring out how they fit together.

She wanted to be part of those conversations so much it ached.
But even more than that,
she wanted to know why things she *hadn't* seen kept popping into her head.
Ghostly shapes flickered behind her eyes if she thought too hard about the plans:
fractal capacitors,
resonant heat sinks,
and ever-so-slightly irregular gears
whose off-center spin would automatically synchronize to minimize power coupling.
She had gone as deep into Hell as she dared to find answers,
but every trail ended in "no results" or a blinking scarlet "restricted" warning.
After a while she had stopped looking,
afraid of who or what might notice.

"Girl! Girl! Dammit, woman, where is that affin' girl?"
Iffy jumped as Uncle Jack bellowed from below deck.
He had been out with his biffs the night before,
which was Uncle Jack-speak for drinking more than he could handle
and gambling more than they could afford.
Aunt Naggie somehow managed to winkle enough out of his app while he was snoring to keep the *Guinevere* afloat,
but it had been weeks since they'd had fruit,
and she couldn't remember the last time there had even been mention of new clothes
or of replacing their frayed nets.

"Girl!" Uncle Jack shouted again.
"Get your affin' tail down here *now* or saints help me you'll be scrapin' barnacles for a *week*!"
His hand made a meaty *thud!* as he slapped the bulkhead for emphasis.

With one last longing look at the machine shop,
Iffy lifted the hatch beside her.
"I'm right here, Uncle Jack," she said. "I was just—"

"You were just lyin' about like some fairytale princess an' don't try to tell me otherways!"
The *Guinevere*'s captain glared up at her,
squinting as the bright sky framing her head assaulted his hungover eyes.
There was a bruise on his forehead that hadn't been there at dinner,
Iffy noticed.
That might mean a visit from the Marines later.
He'd scowl and mutter and make excuses to them,
then bluster to Aunt Naggie after they were gone
about how the governors were just meat puppets
and that the town's cores were going to sell them out to the Zillions
as soon as they could get a decent price.

"Your eggs'll be ready in a mo," Aunt Naggie cut in hurriedly
as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to unleash another bellow.
"Do you want a bit o' curry on them?
I think I have—no, wait, not there…"
She rummaged nervously among the precious little jars
that sat on the shelf beside the galley's two-loop stove.

"Affin' right I want a bit o' curry," Uncle Jack grumbled,
settling into a fold-up chair that squeaked under his weight.

Iffy's stomach grumbled as the smell of eggs, turmeric, and cumin teased her nostrils.
Tilting her frying pan,
Aunt Naggie slid two perfectly fried eggs into Uncle Jack's bowl.
Without so much as a grunt of thanks
her husband took the entire basket of naan from the center of table in one hand
and his plate with the other
and disappeared back into his cabin.
As the door closed
Iffy heard something gurgle out of a bottle.

Aunt Naggie let out the breath she'd been holding
and smiled at her foster daughter.
"You'll be hungry then?"

"Not really," Iffy lied.

"Course not. Here."
She slipped a hard-boiled egg out of the pocket of her apron and handed it to Iffy.
"An' here, this too."
A piece of perfectly-browned naan,
so fresh it was slightly sticky,
appeared out of another pocket.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
"You eat already?"

"Course, first thing," Aunt Naggie lied in turn.
She leaned over and kissed the stubble on top of Iffy's head.
"You best get that in you quick an' start work on the winch cable.
An' he says th' engine's got a knock in it again—best have a look at that too
before it starts to bother him."

"It's the reciprocating rod," Iffy said around a mouthful of naan.
"Mister Mishra will straighten it out if I take it in before he gets busy.
It won't cost nothin',"
she added hastily before her foster mother could object.
"Not if I do a couple o' little jobs for him.
I could head over right now if you wanted."

"If *I* wanted?"
Aunt Naggie teased.
"Well,
if you're goin' that way,
stop in at Sandhu's an' see what they want for more eggs.
Those were our last ones.
I'll tell Jack you're off doin' chores once he's…"
She finished her sentence with an apologetic shrug.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
She climbed the ladder and hurried aft as quietly as she could.

The ship's toolbox rattled as she dragged it out from under the bench at the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Its cast-offs and hand-me-downs only included things so essential that even Uncle Jack wouldn't sell them.
After a furtive glance over her shoulder,
she reached up under the bench and unclipped the canvas bag that held *her* tools,
the ones she had salvaged and mended
or had been given in return for doing odd jobs for people around the harbor.
She pushed the toolbox back into place and tucked her toolbag under her coat.

It only took her a few moments to disengage the bent rod from the engine and tuck it into a pocket.
She closed the engine casing as gently as she could and hurried down the gangplank,
the weight of life on the *Guinevere* lifting from her shoulders
as her boots hit the pier.

<span id="2024-02-16-b"></span>

The Antarctic summer didn't have days or nights,
but ships and people kept to clock time as best they could.
An old couple had woken early
to scrape tweaked barnacles off long strips of plastic they had hung from the pier months before.
Hundreds of little shells glittered with tiny particles of metal they had filtered out of the water.
Ground down and incinerated,
they would yield a few grams of copper or manganese
that could keep some old piece of tech limping along for another season.

One of the women straightened and raised a hand in greeting as Iffy went by.
"Beautiful day," she said. "You headin' t' town?"

"Am that," Iffy nodded,
not wanting to slow down for conversation.

The old woman nodded back.
"You be careful, aye?
The *Taroona* came in yesterday.
Those pirates been bustin' up ever since."

"Thanks," Iffy said dutifully.
The old woman smiled and bent back to her strips and buckets.

The teens at the head of the pier arguing over how best to hang a net for mending
glanced at her as she went by but didn't say anything.
Iffy didn't expect them to.
*At least they don't cross their fingers and spit,* she thought.
Sailors were superstitious, and she was a sole survivor.
Nobody looked at her sidelong
the way they had when the loss of the *Rushin Doll* was still fresh,
but despite Aunt Naggie's efforts,
Iffy had found that friends were something that mostly happened to other people.

*Mishra & Co Fine Technical Work - No Job Too Small!*
occupied a long shed that might actually have been the oldest building in Halley.
The sliding door that took up half its front wall hadn't opened since before she was born,
so she banged on the smaller door cut into it.

It scraped open on her third knock.
"Hey Jeep,"
she said to the boy scowling at her from inside.
"Is your da here?"
She held up the bent reciprocating rod by way of explanation.

"Along back," Jeep muttered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder and making just enough room for Iffy to squeeze past him.

The inside of the shed was a humid mug of long-ago fish,
freshly singed metal,
and the not-entirely-legal compost bricks Mister Mishra burned in the furnace
to keep his equipment from freezing in the winter.
Mismatched lights hung from the ceiling.
The shadows they cast made the compact machines
and shelves of carefully sorted scrap on the shop floor
look like battlebots from old war sims.
They had frightened Iffy the first time she ventured among them,
but all she saw now was what they could make—what *she* could make with them.

Mister Mishra was sharpening his fingers on a grinding wheel in the center of the shop.
He nodded at Iffy but didn't speak until the last sparks had flown off his steel nails
and the wheel spun down to a halt.
Pushing his safety goggles up onto his forehead,
he tugged the calloused fingers of his real hand through the tangles in his beard.
"Buy, sell, or trade?" he asked.

"Trade," Iffy said.
She held up the bent reciprocating rod.
"Tangled some flotsam comin' in from our last dredge.
The engine over-spun before I could get to it.
There's no cracks or nothin'," she added hastily,
handing the piece to him.
"Just needs t' be re-angled an' annealed."

"Hm."
The wiry machinist turned the rod over,
sighted along its length,
then held it up to his good ear and tapped it with his metal fingers.
Iffy had seen him go through this ritual more times than she could count,
but still didn't know if the he was bluffing
or if he really could hear flaws too small for eyes to see.

He handed the rod back to her.
"She'll be right enough once she's straightened," he pronounced.
"But it'll cost you."

The tension eased out of Iffy's shoulders.
Mister Mishra didn't bargain unless he'd already decided that he was going to say yes.
After that it was just a matter of price.

In the end,
getting the rod bent straight cost her half an hour of sorting scraps for smelting.
It wasn't the machine work she'd hoped for,
but she had learned that if she timed her questions right
he would take a minute here and there to show her
how to dog the belaying plate on the laser drill
or line up a set of gatling hammers to rat-a-tat-tat a piece of sheet metal into a graceful springy curve.
She was careful never to stare at the burn scar where his left ear should have been
or at the fractal spider's web of articulated metal that had replaced his left forearm.
She was equally careful not to look up when his son Jeep slouched in
to say that lunch was ready but *amma* said he had to clean up first.

"You hungry?" Mister Mishra asked
as he spun the handwheel on the drill to lift the laser into its locking position.

"No thanks—I brought," Iffy said,
holding up the egg Aunt Naggie had given her.

"Hm." Mister Mishra ran his fingers through his beard again.
"Not much to grow on."

"It'll do me fine,"
Iffy said.
She nodded toward the laser drill as casually as she could.
"You mind I try a couple of pieces while you're out?"

Mister Mishra shook his head.
"Nuh uh, girl.
Nobody touches my darlin' without I'm here to watch.
You break that,
I'll have t' send up t' Amundsen for parts,
and odds are they have t' send all the way up to Taz."

"Aright," Iffy said,
feigning disappointment even though she'd known what the answer would be.
"How about I use th' mechanical one instead?
Just for learnin'," she added hastily.
"It's not paid work or nothin'.
I'll just drill some scrap—you can count it all in an' out t' make sure."

Mister Mishra chuckled.
"No worry about th' scrap, girl.
An' no worry about gettin' paid.
If you found work hereabouts that I haven't, more power to you."
He rolled his head to loosen the kinks in his neck
and waggled the digits of his artificial hand.
"Mind your eyes an' fingers, aye?"

"Aye," Iffy agreed eagerly.
She had her scavenged safety goggles on her face and the drill bit engaged
before Mister Mishra reached the door.
