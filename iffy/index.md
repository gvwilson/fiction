## Chapter 1

<span id="2024-02-15-a"></span>

Iffy had a bad dream that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn't really a dream.

She was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
a hand-me-down ecosuit that had cost as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
"Just t' be safe, love," Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family's youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped Iffy's favorite bedtime book inside the bulky orange suit.
"Just in case."

The ship's horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of bed just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.

Third hugged her again.
"Enough o' that!" Second snapped.
At the time Iffy thought the older clone was angry at her for something she had done.
Years later she realized Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen
and at herself for not being able to stop it.

"She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.
"Two hundred meters ahead an' ten points off starboard!"

Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"I love you always an' forever."

"I love you too," Iffy replied tearfully.
She tried to return Third's hug,
but the thick insulation in the suit made it hard to bend her arms.

Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she always used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterward—that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a million tiny bubbles trapped in ancient clathrate ice were about to burst free.

The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer the *Rushin Doll* out of the mass of foam boiling up around them.
"She's boilin'! She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time.
Third closed the ecosuit's faceplate and mouthed "I love you" one last time.

The ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Iffy screamed as she tumbled onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
Ice-cold sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as the slosh dragged her and her olders against the taffrail.
Her olders grabbed for it,
but the ship dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor
churned the water into a froth too thin to hold the boat afloat.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth falling from the crow's nest,
her arms and legs flailing against the perfect blue sky.

The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.

Her dream stopped then,
just like always.
She didn't remember the sea snapping the *Rushin Doll*'s keel.
She didn't remember being hauled out of the sea in a jelly dredging net hours later,
or standing on the deck of the *Guinevere* for the first time.
But she remembered how blue the sky was,
and how it had felt to be alone for the first time in her life.

The woman she came to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle Iffy had survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she wound up staying on the *Guinevere*.
Her captain,
Uncle Jack,
didn't like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners or the governor
or the co-ops that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie dredged out of the Weddell Sea
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn't have the decency to look at him at all.
He would have dropped her on the pier and sailed away.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn't.
They wouldn't have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?

So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack had two pairs that night,
eights over fives,
but the Aussie across the table had three sixes.
"You were gonna outgrow it anyway,"
he snapped over her tearful protests when she found out it was gone.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow."

He would have gambled away the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn't misplaced it until he forgot about it.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy's age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people made books out of paper
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy re-read it every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her app when she was bored by school,
and on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her,
she took out the book and told them all about *orcinus orca* and *panthera tigris*
and her favorite, *giraffa camelopardalis*.

"They were too real!" she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed any doubts.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as the handwritten comments in the book's margins that she spent hours deciphering.
Real as being poor and lonely
as she grew older
and Uncle Jack's business deals left them with a little less each season.

<span id="2024-02-16-a"></span>

Iffy woke that morning to the sound of Aunt Naggie bustling about in the galley.
She lay on the narrow foam packing slab she used as a mattress for one final precious moment
before slithering out of her salvaged sleeping bag
and pulling a layer of clothes over her thermals.
The noise was her foster mother's way of telling her that Uncle Jack was awake
and that she should be up on deck doing something useful
before he stumbled out into the light looking for someone to yell at.

She closed her eyes and opened her nature book at random.
It was ridiculous—Jeep had made fun of her for a month
when he found out—but…

"Figures," she muttered when she opened her eyes.
The armadillo wasn't the most ridiculous animal in the book,
but it wasn't her favorite.
Still,
an armadillo day was better than a blobfish day.
She tucked the book back under her mattress,
yawned,
rubbed the stubble on her scalp,
and undogged the door of the storage locker
that had been her bedroom for the past eight years.

Stepping onto the deck of the *Guinevere* was like being born:
everything was suddenly bright and cold and loud and smelly and amazing.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the light.
To seaward lay the broken hulk of a carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to create a seawall for the town's harbor.
Dozens of ships, large and small, bobbed up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years like the *Guinevere* to stay seaworthy.
Others were newer:
broad-beamed cargo haulers flying the Aussie stars
or sleek Zillion-built clippers with bright kite sails furled around triple masts.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about that nobody threw away anything worth eating any more.

The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Once upon a time,
Halley had been a research station where scientists studied the early signs of the Melt.
As the ice disappeared and life back home became desperate
they converted their labs into temporary houses.
By the time their children were grown they had stopped doing research
or calling the houses "temporary".

Two thousand people now made Halley their home under the governors' watchful eyes.
During the summer blooms they dredged jellyfish out of the sea
to render down for fuel and fertilizer.
When winter came they tended the town's precious greenhouses
or sailed north to Patagonia or Tasmania
to find work that would get them through the long dark.

Iffy shaded her eyes against the razor-edged sun.
A cluster of buildings was taking shape by the new pier on the edge of town.
Two were just bunkhouses,
but the third—the one Iffy had watched go up like a hungry gull waiting for scraps—was a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equipment had already been carted through its double-wide doors:
forges, presses,
a lathe with a spindle thicker than Iffy's leg,
and the prize of them all,
a printer from Nova Zembla at the opposite end of the earth.

It had arrived in the hold of a heavily-armed Aussie destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when the warship came into harbor,
railguns bristling and drones darting back and forth above her.
They lined the streets and cheered
as the destroyer's crew and a squad of Marines escorted the boxy machine through Halley's streets
to the town's quarantine shed.
Once Halley's core finished its months-long check for malware,
the only limit to what the printer could make
would be the plans and raw materials people could give it.

Iffy had seen some of those plans glowing softly on apps in Halley's three cafés.
She had taken surreptitious notes on her app instead of doing homework
while mechanics and engineers and core techs argued about weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients,
then spent hours looking up words she didn't know and figuring out how they fit together.

She wanted to be part of those conversations so much it ached.
But even more than that,
she wanted to know why things she *hadn't* seen kept popping into her head.
Ghostly shapes flickered behind her eyes if she thought too hard about the plans:
fractal capacitors,
resonant heat sinks,
and ever-so-slightly irregular gears
whose off-center spin would automatically synchronize to minimize power coupling.
She had gone as deep into Hell as she dared to find answers,
but every trail ended in "no results" or a blinking scarlet "restricted" warning.
After a while she had stopped looking,
afraid of who or what might notice.

"Girl! Girl! Dammit, woman, where is that affin' girl?"
Iffy jumped as Uncle Jack bellowed from below deck.
He had been out with his biffs the night before,
which was Uncle Jack-speak for drinking more than he could handle
and gambling more than they could afford.
Aunt Naggie somehow managed to winkle enough out of his app while he was snoring to keep the *Guinevere* afloat,
but it had been weeks since they'd had fruit,
and she couldn't remember the last time there had even been mention of new clothes
or of replacing their frayed nets.

"Girl!" Uncle Jack shouted again.
"Get your affin' tail down here *now* or saints help me you'll be scrapin' barnacles for a *week*!"
His hand made a meaty *thud!* as he slapped the bulkhead for emphasis.

With one last longing look at the machine shop,
Iffy lifted the hatch beside her.
"I'm right here, Uncle Jack," she said. "I was just—"

"You were just lyin' about like some fairytale princess an' don't try to tell me otherways!"
The *Guinevere*'s captain glared up at her,
squinting as the bright sky framing her head assaulted his hungover eyes.
There was a bruise on his forehead that hadn't been there at dinner,
Iffy noticed.
That might mean a visit from the Marines later.
He'd scowl and mutter and make excuses to them,
then bluster to Aunt Naggie after they were gone
about how the governors were just meat puppets
and that the town's cores were going to sell them out to the Zillions
as soon as they could get a decent price.

"Your eggs'll be ready in a mo," Aunt Naggie cut in hurriedly
as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to unleash another bellow.
"Do you want a bit o' curry on them?
I think I have—no, wait, not there…"
She rummaged nervously among the precious little jars
that sat on the shelf beside the galley's two-loop stove.

"Affin' right I want a bit o' curry," Uncle Jack grumbled,
settling into a fold-up chair that squeaked under his weight.

Iffy's stomach grumbled as the smell of eggs, turmeric, and cumin teased her nostrils.
Tilting her frying pan,
Aunt Naggie slid two perfectly fried eggs into Uncle Jack's bowl.
Without so much as a grunt of thanks
her husband took the entire basket of naan from the center of table in one hand
and his plate with the other
and disappeared back into his cabin.
As the door closed
Iffy heard something gurgle out of a bottle.

Aunt Naggie let out the breath she'd been holding
and smiled at her foster daughter.
"You'll be hungry then?"

"Not really," Iffy lied.

"Course not. Here."
She slipped a hard-boiled egg out of the pocket of her apron and handed it to Iffy.
"An' here, this too."
A piece of perfectly-browned naan,
so fresh it was slightly sticky,
appeared out of another pocket.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
"You eat already?"

"Course, first thing," Aunt Naggie lied in turn.
She leaned over and kissed the stubble on top of Iffy's head.
"You best get that in you quick an' start work on the winch cable.
An' he says th' engine's got a knock in it again—best have a look at that too
before it starts to bother him."

"It's the reciprocating rod," Iffy said around a mouthful of naan.
"Mister Mishra will straighten it out if I take it in before he gets busy.
It won't cost nothin',"
she added hastily before her foster mother could object.
"Not if I do a couple o' little jobs for him.
I could head over right now if you wanted."

"If *I* wanted?"
Aunt Naggie teased.
"Well,
if you're goin' that way,
stop in at Sandhu's an' see what they want for more eggs.
Those were our last ones.
I'll tell Jack you're off doin' chores once he's…"
She finished her sentence with an apologetic shrug.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
She climbed the ladder and hurried aft as quietly as she could.

The ship's toolbox rattled as she dragged it out from under the bench at the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Its cast-offs and hand-me-downs only included things so essential that even Uncle Jack wouldn't sell them.
After a furtive glance over her shoulder,
she reached up under the bench and unclipped the canvas bag that held *her* tools,
the ones she had salvaged and mended
or had been given in return for doing odd jobs for people around the harbor.
She pushed the toolbox back into place and tucked her toolbag under her coat.

It only took her a few moments to disengage the bent rod from the engine and tuck it into a pocket.
She closed the engine casing as gently as she could and hurried down the gangplank,
the weight of life on the *Guinevere* lifting from her shoulders
as her boots hit the pier.

<span id="2024-02-16-b"></span>

The Antarctic summer didn't have days or nights,
but ships and people kept to clock time as best they could.
An old couple had woken early
to scrape tweaked barnacles off long strips of plastic they had hung from the pier months before.
Hundreds of little shells glittered with tiny particles of metal they had filtered out of the water.
Ground down and incinerated,
they would yield a few grams of copper or manganese
that could keep some old piece of tech limping along for another season.

One of the women straightened and raised a hand in greeting as Iffy went by.
"Beautiful day," she said. "You headin' t' town?"

"Am that," Iffy nodded,
not wanting to slow down for conversation.

The old woman nodded back.
"You be careful, aye?
The *Taroona* came in yesterday.
Those pirates been bustin' up ever since."

"Thanks," Iffy said dutifully.
The old woman smiled and bent back to her strips and buckets.

The teens at the head of the pier arguing over how best to hang a net for mending
glanced at her as she went by but didn't say anything.
Iffy didn't expect them to.
*At least they don't cross their fingers and spit,* she thought.
Sailors were superstitious, and she was a sole survivor.
Nobody looked at her sidelong
the way they had when the loss of the *Rushin Doll* was still fresh,
but despite Aunt Naggie's efforts,
Iffy had found that friends were something that mostly happened to other people.

*Mishra & Co Fine Technical Work - No Job Too Small!*
occupied a long shed that might actually have been the oldest building in Halley.
The sliding door that took up half its front wall hadn't opened since before she was born,
so she banged on the smaller door cut into it.

It scraped open on her third knock.
"Hey Jeep,"
she said to the boy scowling at her from inside.
"Is your da here?"
She held up the bent reciprocating rod by way of explanation.

"Along back," Jeep muttered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder and making just enough room for Iffy to squeeze past him.

The inside of the shed was a humid mug of long-ago fish,
freshly singed metal,
and the not-entirely-legal compost bricks Mister Mishra burned in the furnace
to keep his equipment from freezing in the winter.
Mismatched lights hung from the ceiling.
The shadows they cast made the compact machines
and shelves of carefully sorted scrap on the shop floor
look like battlebots from old war sims.
They had frightened Iffy the first time she ventured among them,
but all she saw now was what they could make—what *she* could make with them.

Mister Mishra was sharpening his fingers on a grinding wheel in the center of the shop.
He nodded at Iffy but didn't speak until the last sparks had flown off his steel nails
and the wheel spun down to a halt.
Pushing his safety goggles up onto his forehead,
he tugged the calloused fingers of his real hand through the tangles in his beard.
"Buy, sell, or trade?" he asked.

"Trade," Iffy said.
She held up the bent reciprocating rod.
"Tangled some flotsam comin' in from our last dredge.
The engine over-spun before I could get to it.
There's no cracks or nothin'," she added hastily,
handing the piece to him.
"Just needs t' be re-angled an' annealed."

"Hm."
The wiry machinist turned the rod over,
sighted along its length,
then held it up to his good ear and tapped it with his metal fingers.
Iffy had seen him go through this ritual more times than she could count,
but still didn't know if the he was bluffing
or if he really could hear flaws too small for eyes to see.

He handed the rod back to her.
"She'll be right enough once she's straightened," he pronounced.
"But it'll cost you."

The tension eased out of Iffy's shoulders.
Mister Mishra didn't bargain unless he'd already decided that he was going to say yes.
After that it was just a matter of price.

In the end,
getting the rod bent straight cost her half an hour of sorting scraps for smelting.
It wasn't the machine work she'd hoped for,
but she had learned that if she timed her questions right
he would take a minute here and there to show her
how to dog the belaying plate on the laser drill
or line up a set of gatling hammers to rat-a-tat-tat a piece of sheet metal into a graceful springy curve.
She was careful never to stare at the burn scar where his left ear should have been
or at the fractal spider's web of articulated metal that had replaced his left forearm.
She was equally careful not to look up when his son Jeep slouched in
to say that lunch was ready but *amma* said he had to clean up first.

"You hungry?" Mister Mishra asked
as he spun the handwheel on the drill to lift the laser into its locking position.

"No thanks—I brought," Iffy said,
holding up the egg Aunt Naggie had given her.

"Hm." Mister Mishra ran his fingers through his beard again.
"Not much to grow on."

"It'll do me fine,"
Iffy said.
She nodded toward the laser drill as casually as she could.
"You mind I try a couple of pieces while you're out?"

Mister Mishra shook his head.
"Nuh uh, girl.
Nobody touches my darlin' without I'm here to watch.
You break that,
I'll have t' send up t' Amundsen for parts,
and odds are they have t' send all the way up to Taz."

"Aright," Iffy said,
feigning disappointment even though she'd known what the answer would be.
"How about I use th' mechanical one instead?
Just for learnin'," she added hastily.
"It's not paid work or nothin'.
I'll just drill some scrap—you can count it all in an' out t' make sure."

Mister Mishra chuckled.
"No worry about th' scrap, girl.
An' no worry about gettin' paid.
If you found work hereabouts that I haven't, more power to you."
He rolled his head to loosen the kinks in his neck
and waggled the digits of his artificial hand.
"Mind your eyes an' fingers, aye?"

"Aye," Iffy agreed eagerly.
She had her scavenged safety goggles on her face and the drill bit engaged
before Mister Mishra reached the door.

<span id="2024-02-17-a"></span>

Drilling holes wasn't hard—she'd mastered that long ago.
The hard part was drilling them in the right place.
After examining and discarding half a dozen pieces of scrap,
she found one that was bent enough to be a challenge.

The first hole only took a minute.
It then took her another fifteen minutes to measure,
mark,
measure again,
swear under her breath,
find a pair of calipers in the chaos on top of Mister Mishra's toolbench,
chock the piece,
measure a third time,
and re-align everything juuuuust a little.
A bot could have done the whole job in a couple of seconds,
but bots had malware—at least,
the kinds of bots that people in Halley could afford.
"You want it fast, use a bot," Mister Mishra always said.
"You want it *right*, do it yourself."

Slowly, steadily, Iffy brought the spinning drillbit down
until it just barely kissed the metal and—

"What are you doin'?"
She jumped and spun around.
Jeep was leaning against a set of shelves,
arms crossed and scowl firmly in place.

"What're you doin' sneakin' up on me like that?" she demanded.
"Aren't you supposed t' be havin' lunch or something?"

His scowl deepened.
"Finished. Does my da know what you're about?"

"Course he does."
Iffy scratched a sudden itch on her nose,
then pulled her hand back down to her side.
Mister Mishra *did* know, and she had nothing to be embarrassed about.

"Uh huh. What about your uncle?" Jeep asked,
looking everywhere but straight at her.
"He still bein' trash on you?"

Iffy shrugged.
"Comes an' goes."
She and Jeep had talked a few times
when she first started coming by.
He had shown her a few of his sims
and she had shared a few stories about life at sea.
For a while she had thought he was working up the courage
to do something more than just talk,
but…

The silence stretched uncomfortably.
"I gotta get back t' this," she finally said,
waving a hand at the drill press idling behind her.

Jeep straightened up.
"Wouldn't you rather be doin' somethin useful?"

"This *is* useful!" Iffy said hotly.
"And it's none o' your business what I do or don't."
She turned back to the drill,
placing her foot firmly on the pedal that controlled the motor's speed.

"Just be careful," Jeep said belligerently.
"Da's double worried about that new printer takin' work away.
If anythin' here gets bust up—"

"Anythin' here gets bust up your da will know it was me that did it
because it ain't like *you* ever put your hands to any o' this!"
Iffy snapped.
She cranked the drill bit up into its locked position and switched the machine off.
"Here!"
Three quick twists undid the chocks that held her test piece in place.
She tossed it at him harder than the distance required,
then took the calipers from the work tray on the side of the drill
and slapped them back onto the bench.
"Gimme a sec an' I'll sweep up th' shavings for you to weigh
so you can be sure I ain't fillin' my pockets or nothin'."

Without waiting for answer she pulled the goggles down around her neck
and grabbed the old broom that stood next to a broken sonic press like a forgotten sentry.
Jeep watched her sweep,
anger and something that might have been embarrassment written on his face.
"You missed a bit," he finally said,
jerking his chin at a random patch of floor before turning and stalking away.
The door banged behind him.

Iffy emptied the dustpan into the trash and tossed her goggles into her toolbag.
It wasn't fair—Jeep could use the equipment any time he wanted,
but all he ever did was complain and look for ways not to.

The worst thing was,
she knew it wasn't Jeep's fault he was like this.
Like everyone else in Antarctica
he had been inducted into the Marines when he turned sixteen.
He'd only served a quarter—just long enough to be sure that the imprinting had worked—but
having someone else's personality temporarily pushed down on top of his own had changed him.
"He'll come back eventually,"
Mister Mishra said the one time Iffy broached the subject,
his tone making it clear that she shouldn't bring it up again.
"It just takes some folk longer than others to find their way home."

The sky was the same relentless blue it had been an hour earlier when Iffy stepped outside,
the mended reciprocating rod tucked inside her coat.
She peeled her egg as she walked toward the grocery store,
trying not to get grease on the rubbery white flesh and the warm yellow-brown yolk.
A couple of Aunt Naggie's friends smiled or waved as she went by.
She nodded back,
ignoring the others who tsk'ed to each other
at the sight of a scruffy little jelly dredger
in a stained coat two sizes too big for her.

A commotion down a side street caught her ear.
Someone was singing off-key.
Another voice joined in, then a third, and then glass broke on stone.
"Bloody pirates," a passer-by muttered to his companion.
"Governors shoulda sunk the *Taroona*, not let her berth."
The second man grunted acknowledgment.
Iffy kept her eyes on the cobblestones and picked up her pace.

Sandhu's grocery store was out of eggs.
They had onions,
though,
and a box of dried green peppers that had come in from somewhere carefully unspecified.
Little Mrs. Sandhu wrapped half a dozen slices in wax paper.
"For your beautiful aunt," she said over Iffy's protests,
just as she did every time she gave her something extra.
"An' here,
a little of our special curry mix.
I know how much you like it."
She handed Iffy a small plastic jar of orange-brown powder.

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted just as *she* always did.
"You should take Nagatha your presents yourself," she scolded.

Her wife smiled.
"*La,* but where would be th' romance in that?"

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted again.
Whatever Little Mrs. Sandhu might have said next
was cut short by a jingle from the bell on the store's front door.
Three heads turned at a cheerful, "Good morning!"
as the squarest man Iffy had ever seen walked in.

<span id="2024-02-17-b"></span>

"Square" really was the only word for him.
He wasn't much taller than Iffy,
but three of her could have stood side by side in the span of his shoulders.
Strong white teeth gleamed against his black skin when he smiled,
and the flickering silver rectangles in his temples
made him look like he had stepped out of an adventure sim.

"Good mornin, *sri*," Big Mrs. Sandhu said, bowing her head slightly.
"Is there something we could help you with?"

"Just some advice, ma'am, if you've any of that for sale?"
His twanging accent sounded American to Iffy,
though the only Americans she had ever heard had been market preachers
or villains in sims.

"Advice is always free here," Little Mrs. Sandhu simpered,
wiping her hands on her apron.
Big Mrs. Sandhu looked sidelong at Iffy and rolled her eyes.
Iffy bit back a laugh—Little Mrs. Sandhu's flirting was as famous in Halley
as her smuggled vegetables.

"Thank you kindly," the square man said.
"I'm just in from South Georgia,
and find myself in need of a place to stay for a few days.
I don't suppose you could recommend somewhere that isn't too expensive?"
He spread his hands apologetically.
"It seems that my luggage went missing in transit."

"Oh you poor *cho*," Little Mrs. Sandhu clucked sympathetically.

Big Mrs. Sandhu shook her head.
"That'd be the *Taroona* you come in on?"
When the newcomer nodded she shook her head again.
"They're *bura badi*,
that crew,
pirates and leggers and worse.
You're lucky if all they nickered was your bags an' not your kidneys."

The square man sighed.
"That may be, but I confess that I don't feel particularly lucky.
I was hoping to set myself up in business, but without my tools…"
He shrugged.

"What kind o' tools?" Iffy asked.
She had been about to slip away—her uncle would be looking for her soon,
and she didn't want to leave Aunt Naggie to deal with his ire on her own—but
tools were worth a few extra seconds.

The square man grimaced.
"A couple of half-mil waldoes,
a sintering laser,
a fractal de-ionizer for cleaning chaff off old cores,
a set of diffraction lenses,
and—"

"There's no such thing as a fractal de-ionizer,"
Iffy cut in scornfully.

The square man blinked.
"Sure there is.
You take the ionizer out of a differential micromagnetic filter,
stick it in a high-conductance fractal mesh,
and boom—there's your de-ionizer."

"Huh.
Feedback would slag that th' second you turned it on,"
Iffy scoffed.

"If you're careless, sure," the square man agreed.
"You have to recalibrate the impedance every once in a while so that it doesn't overheat.
But if you have a micropore evaporator—"

"—you can use liquid nitrogen to quench the thermal,"
Iffy finished,
the solution suddenly clear in her head.

"Exactly."
The newcomer cocked his head,
looking at Iffy as if she was some strange machine brought in for repair.

"Well, if you two are done comparin' notes,
there's a coupla places I can point you at,"
Big Mrs. Sandhu cut in briskly.
"Can't promise they'll be cheap,
but they're clean,
an' you won't wake up in the middle o' the night with any o' your parts gone."

"Thank you," the square man said absently, still studying Iffy.
"And if you don't mind me asking another question,
where did your daughter learn so much about tech?
There are people with a lot of years behind them
who wouldn't have thought about the resonance feedback."

"Oh, Iffy's not ours,"
Little Mrs. Sandhu said lightly.
"She's crew off the *Guinevere*."

"I see."
The square man nodded as if that explained everything
and stuck out his hand.
"Johnson Wales," he said.
"Pleased to meet you."

Iffy hesitated,
then took his hand and shook it.
"Fifth Ang Kwan, but everyone calls me Iffy.
Pleased to meet you too."

## Chapter 2

Iffy ran all the way back to the pier,
dodging around the people and occasional bots going about their chores
in Halley's narrow cobblestone streets.
"*Gardez-vous!* *Gardez-vous!*"
scolded the centipede-shaped fixit bot everyone called French Henry.
She squeezed between its rust-streaked frame
and a rack of insulating moss someone had set out to dry in the sun
and kept running.

The barnacle farmers were still bent over their work when she reached the pier.
She stopped and put her hands on her knees to catch her breath.
"How's yer haul?" she panted.

"Not bad," one of them said.
She nudged a scratched blue bucket with her boot.
"Prob'ly get thirty grams outta this when it renders down.
That'll buy a nice dinner."
Her smile showed more gaps than teeth.

"Good luck," Iffy said.
She straightened up and walked quickly the rest of the way to the *Guinevere*,
her lips moving as she practiced what she was going to say.

Metal clanged on metal as she reached the ship.
"Affin'… shaddin'… dammit!" Uncle Jack swore,
a wrench in one hand and a screw cuff in the other.
Iffy's heart sank.
He was trying to mend the backstay cable that had snapped a few days ago.
It was a fiddly job at the best of times,
and if he had a hangover…

The scowl on his face turned stormy as he caught sight of her.
"Where th' hole you been, girl?" he demanded,
waving the wrench at her.
"There's work needs done!
An don't give me any excuses!"
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
"You get this mended or so help me!"

"But—"

"Now!"
Heads turned on nearby ships as Uncle Jack's bellow echoed across the water.

Iffy's heart sank a second time when she saw the mess waiting for her.
Her uncle had undone the screw cuff holding the frayed backstay cable together
and trimmed the two ends flat.
He hadn't left enough to weave back together,
not without shortening the cable by half a meter.
She would have to swap the whole cable for one of the forestays,
which meant an hour at least of unwinding and hauling.

Uncle Jack crossed his arms,
tapping his wrench against the stained thermal vest
he had worn for as long as Iffy could remember.
"So where you been while th' rest of us been workin', eh?"

"Groceries," Iffy said sullenly.
She pulled the mended reciprocating rod out of her jacket and held it up.
"Got this fixed too."

Uncle Jack pulled it roughly from her hand.
"Don't see no groceries," he grumbled accusingly,
squinting at the rod
before thrusting it back at her.

"I just asked her to pick up a coupla things,"
Aunt Naggie said,
sticking her head up through an open hatch
like a turtle cautiously checking that the world outside its shell was safe.
"Did they have eggs?"

"Nope, but I got some peppers."
Iffy fished the items she had bought out of her jacket's deep pockets.
"Oh, an' this is from Little Mrs. Sandhu."
She held up the jar of curry powder.

"Oh, that's kind," Aunt Naggie clucked,
tucking everything into her apron.
"Did you get anythin' more to eat?
I was going t' make noodles."

"It's aright, I'm not hungry," Iffy lied,
and then she couldn't hold back any longer.
"But auntie,
there was a man at Sandhu's,
a mechanic come down to work in th' machine shop,
'cept he was on the *Taroona* and they stole his gear
so he was askin' after a place t' stay,
an' we got to talkin',
an' he said that if he could get his tools back an' find work an all,
he might be lookin' for an apprentice."

"An apprentice?" Aunt Naggie echoed.
"Well, good for Jeep.
It's about time he got out and did somethin'."

"Not Jeep!" Iffy exclaimed.
"He said he'd look to take me!"
The two Mrs. Sandhus had listened with bemusement
as her conversation with Mister Wales—"call me Johnson, please"—leaped from de-ionizers
to different ways to micro-weld cracks in core cases
to the mended reciprocating rod Iffy took out of her coat to show him.
It wasn't until Big Mrs. Sandhu had cleared her throat
and pointedly suggested that the conversation continue
where they *wouldn't* be blocking the aisle
that Iffy had realized how much time had gone by.

Uncle Jack's hand came down heavily on her shoulder.
"You're not goin' anywhere," he growled,
shaking her for emphasis.
"Not 'til you've paid off every last rand you owe me
for lookin' after you all this time."

Something froze inside Iffy.
"Aright," she said coldly,
knocking his arm away.
"How 'bout you an' me go ask the *Ginny* to pull up the accounts
so I can see just how much that is,
and I'll tell you how much you owe me
for keeping her afloat when you're too wrung out to do it yourself,
an' then we'll see who owes who what!"

"What we'll see is how well you swim!"
Uncle Jack roared,
raising the heavy wrench he was holding like a club.

"No!"
Aunt Naggie yanked Iffy back and stepped in front of her irate husband.
"Jack, don't!
She's just talkin',
that's all."

Uncle Jack shook the wrench at them.
"I best see more outta both of you than just talkin'," he snarled.
"Now get me some affin' lunch, woman.
And you!"
He jabbed a finger at Iffy.
"Fix that shaddin' cable.
I want us ready to sail tomorrow."

"She'll do it right away, I promise," Aunt Naggie said.
Her arm tightened around Iffy's shoulders,
a silent warning not to say anything.

Uncle Jack stalked off,
muttering under his breath.
"You come below and help me with th' noodles,"
Aunt Naggie said,
shooing Iffy toward the open hatch.
"That'll give him time to calm down."

"Yes auntie," Iffy said,
her voice only slightly shaky.
Uncle Jack had never actually hit her—as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*'s core was,
it would still instantly report that to the Marines
who served as Halley's police.
But with each passing season,
as the *Guinevere* slowly fell apart beneath them despite Iffy's hard work,
his if-only stories about big deals that were just over the horizon
had turned into angry tirades and sullen silences.
Iffy didn't know where she would go,
and she couldn't bear the thought of leaving Aunt Naggie to face him alone,
but she knew that one day soon she was going to walk down the gangplank
and never come back.

One day—but not today.

The *Guinevere*'s galley wasn't big enough for two people to do anything side by side
except get in each other's way,
so Iffy sat at its little fold-down table
and watched Aunt Naggie work with the efficiency of long practice.
Within minutes,
two thinly-sliced onions sizzled in a battered ceramic frying pan
while a pot of desalinated water came to the boil.
A handful of diced mushrooms and a splash of soy sauce joined the onions,
filling the air with a rich aroma that tightened the knot in Iffy's stomach.

The knot turned into an ache as Aunt Naggie added some of her precious spices.
"Is that Mrs. Sandhu's curry?" Iffy asked,
turning a pair of chopsticks over and over in her hands.

"Mm hm."
Aunt Naggie fished the little jar out of her apron,
sprinkled a little into the simmering mixture,
then tucked the jar at the back of her spice shelf.
"I save it for special occasions."
She dropped a thick handful of noodles into the pot,
glanced at her foster daughter,
and added a few more.

Iffy put the chopstick back on the table.
"What's so special 'bout today?" she grumbled.

Aunt Naggie smiled without looking up from her cooking.
"Any time I cook for just th' two of us is special,"
she said,
knocking bits of onion off her spatula into the frying pan.
"But best we don't mention that to Jack, aright?"

"Sure," Iffy said,
feeling a knot in her chest to match the one in her stomach.
She stood up and hugged Aunt Naggie from behind.
"You know I won't leave you, aye?"

Her foster mother's shoulders slumped slightly.
She moved the frying pan off the induction loop
and turned around to wrap her arms around the skinny young woman
who had somehow replaced the skinny little girl
she used to sing songs to at bedtime.
"I love you too, *cho*," she said,
kissing Iffy's shaved head.
"But when your chance comes, you take it, aright?"
She squeezed Iffy.
"Now, scootch over."

A few minutes later Iffy sat down on deck
with her back against the wheelhouse door
and a steaming bowl of noodles in her lap.
She bowed her head and said a brief prayer for the olders she could barely remember,
then began scooping food into her mouth.
Not even the sound of her uncle grumbling belowdecks
could spoil the spicy sweet taste in her mouth
or the feeling of her belly slowly relaxing.

When the noodles were gone
she wiped the last drops of sauce out of the bowl with her thumb
and licked it.
The faint tang of machine oil on her unwashed hand barely registered.
She sighed.
She would like nothing better than to close her eyes and let the summer sun warm her face,
but the backstay cable *did* need mending,
and it wasn't as if the engine was going to put itself back together—not
on a ship as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*.

She patted her coat
to check that the reciprocating rod was still in her pocket
and hauled herself to her feet.
Down at the base of the pier,
one of the barnacle farmers had a pole balanced across her shoulders
with a large bucket on each end.
The other had stacked the smaller buckets on a two-wheeled cart
and was gently lowering their precious sheets of plastic back into the sea.
They would haul in on the next pier tomorrow,
then the next and the next
until their circuit brought them back to where they had started.
They had been doing it since before Iffy was born.
It kept them fed,
but little more,
and Iffy would be damned and drowned before she would let anything like that become her life.

Without warning a sketch materialized somewhere between her eyes and her brain.
Two toothed wheels to reel in the strips of plastic,
a sharp-edged scraper to pry the barnacles off,
a lens connected to a tiny core set just so in a wire frame
to steer the scraper so that it didn't dig into the plastic…
The parts would only cost a dozen rand,
and it would save the old women an hour or two every day.
Mister Mishra had everything except the frame,
but that would be easy to print.
She could actually make it,
she realized with mounting excitement.
She could make it and sell it to the barnacle farmers and—

*BOOM!*
The explosion sounded like someone slamming the world's biggest box down
on the world's biggest table.
A roiling mass of smoke billowed up into the sky on the edge of town.
"Oh shad!" Iffy gasped.
It was the new machine shop!

A siren wailed.
Others joined it.
She heard Uncle Jack bellow,
"What'n hole you done now, girl?"
but she was already racing down the gangplank.

By the time she reached the machine shop
a small crowd had gathered on the paved turnaround in front of it.
Something like panic rose in her throat
when she saw that the explosion hadn't been in the building itself
but in the squat blockhouse beside it
where the industrial printer was sitting in quarantine.

One corner of the blockhouse had collapsed
into a tangle of masonry chunks and twisted foam steel beams.
A rough-looking woman in a green and yellow vest
was standing in front of its single door
arguing loudly with two men in dark blue Marine uniforms.
"An' *I* said I'll open it when my captain tells me to!"
she said hotly,
uncrossing muscular arms thick with tattoos.

Two more Marines pushed through the crowd,
a sidekick drone whining faintly over their heads.
One of them pointed at the sergeant's stripes on his sleeve.
"Do you see these, citizen?" he demanded.
"These indicate that I have authority to direct action
as I think most consistent with regulations regarding general public safety.
We will therefore proceed to inspect this site regardless of your wishes."

The woman's lip curled.
"Consistent wi' regulations, is it?" she mimicked.
"Well that means nought to me,
mate,
so you an' your brainmush friends can—oy!"
She stepped sideways to block one of the Marines
as he moved toward the door.

"Clear away! Clear away, all o' you!"
The crowded parted hastily at the shouted order.
Half a dozen sailors pushed through the crowd,
all of them wearing variations on the woman's yellow-and-green vest
with *Taroona* stencilled on the back.
"Uh oh," Iffy heard someone mutter.

The shaven-headed woman leading the new arrivals put her hands on her hips.
"Y'arra, Bags?" she asked,
glaring at the Marine sergeant,
the crowd,
and everything else in sight for good measure.

"Kappa, cap'n," the first woman growled.
"Just 'splainin' t' these lot that there ain't nothin' here needs corra look-in."

"With respect, citizen," the sergeant said,
his inducted accent making his calm words ridiculous and ominous at the same time,
"Any potential danger to the residents or property of Halley
is a proper subject of our attention.
Particularly anything that might turn us into another Bharati."

The crowd murmured.
Twenty years before,
someone's home-brew tech had gone up in flames in Bharati.
Dozens had died as fire swept through the small town,
and dozens more from exposure in the days that followed.
Iffy had never asked Mister Mishra about that night,
but every year,
on the anniversary,
he and the Sandhus and their friends gathered on the piers
to toss handfuls of precious flowers into the sea.

The *Taroona*'s crew ignored the mutters of "Too right" and "Just let 'em look"
from the crowd.
One sailor hefted a gaff hook.
Another wrapped a length of chain around her hand
as the twin or clone beside her rolled her head from side to side to loosen it.
"Well this ain't Bharati,"
the *Taroona*'s captain said to the sergeant.
"Contract says we're to mind everythin' we hauled down from Taz
'til Halley core tells us otherways,
so whatever happened here is on us t' fix."

The sergeant looked at the debris on the ground.
"Do you regard this as 'taking care', citizen?" has asked pointedly.

The *Taroona*'s captain crossed her arms.
"That ain't our doin'," she said firmly.
"Printer don't have any feedstock in it, not yet.
Couldna made a marble, much less a bomb."
She looked up at the drone circling overhead.
"So *I* think this was someone messin' around tryin' t' do us outta bein' paid,"
she said loudly,
her words aimed at Halley's core and the watching governors.

"I agree your analysis is likely," the sergeant said.
"But I still insist on inspecting this site directly."
In one choreographed motion,
he and the three Marines beside him
drew their shock sticks from the holsters on their hips.

"Oh shad," someone said quietly beside Iffy.
"It's gonna be a jammer."

Iffy gulped.
She had never seen a fight worse than teenagers shoving each other,
but Uncle Jack had been in several over the years.
The last time they were in Rothera
he had come back to the *Guinevere* bruised and bloodied
and uncharacteristically quiet about what had happened.
As the Marines' uniform jackets hardened into armor,
she turned to find somewhere safer to be.

And bumped right into Johnson Wales.
"'Scuse me," she muttered before she realized who he was.

"No worries," he said pleasantly.
"I was actually just leaving myself.
Here—could you give me a hand?"
Without waiting for an answer
he handed her a bulky black case with a flip-up handle on its lid
and stooped to pick up its two identical twins.

"What—?" Iffy started to ask.

"Ssh!" Wales cut her off and looked up at the drone circling overhead.
Without warning its buzzing stopped
and it fell from the sky like a rock.

"Oy, that weren't us!" the *Taroona*'s captain protested,
but it was too late.
As the drone clattered on the cobblestones,
the sergeant blew his whistle.
Moving as one,
the squad charged the sailors.

A shock stick sizzled and cracked.
Someone shouted an obscenity,
and suddenly people were running past Iffy
as the sailors and Marines did what sailors and Marines have been doing
for as long as there have been sailors and Marines.

"Come on," Wales urged Iffy.
She hurried after him,
the case bumping against her leg.

"Oy!" a voice shouted.
"You there!
Where th' hole d'you think you're goin'?"
A rangy man in a yellow-and-green vest with a half-star tattooed on his face
shoved a couple of people out of his way and grabbed Iffy by the arm.

And there it was in her head,
like a wireframe of a machine labelled with angles and velocities.
Without thinking she spun around,
swinging the case in a sharp arc.
Its rising edge hit the *Taroona* crewman beneath his knee with a crack.

"Aargh! Shaddin' hack, ya wheezy—"
The case in Wales' right hand thudded against the sailor's head.
He collapsed to the cobblestones in a heap.

"Come on!"
Wales urged as two of the *Taroona*'s crew spotted their fallen comrade
and began shoving their way through the panic to even the score.

Iffy ran,
or tried to,
but the case was heavy and awkward
and the women chasing her were half again her height
and could knock people aside instead of going around them
or pushing in between them and what had just happened?
How could she have seen what she needed to do like that?

Just as one of the sailors yelled, "Gotcha!" another voice shouted "*Gardez-vous!*"
Iffy yelped as a familiar rust-stained bot reared up in front of her.
The sailor behind her skidded to a halt on the cobblestones
and was knocked sprawling as her partner slammed into her from behind.

"Rogue! Rogue!"
the second sailor shouted,
dodging back as French Henry clacked a manipulator at her.

"Come on!"
Wales pulled her away.

For a few moments all Iffy could do was try not to stumble and fall.
Just when she couldn't hold onto the case any longer
Wales pulled her into a side alley.
A few drops of sweat glistened on his forehead.
"Are you all right?" he panted.

Iffy dropped the case on the ground and doubled over to catch her breath.
"No, I'm not aright," she wheezed.
"I just about got my chomper clocked back there!
And what's this?"
She kicked the case with the toe of her boot.
"This what th' *Taroona* bikkies upped from you?"

Wales nodded.
"Everything that matters."
Tiny lights danced briefly across the silver rectangles in his temples.
He looked up as an angry drone buzzed overhead.
Another followed it a moment later.
"Come on.
The Marines have called for reinforcements—we should be somewhere else when they arrive."

Wales led her out the other end of the alley
onto a narrow street lined with two-story houses made of laser-cut stones.
Sparkling blue-green moss traced their mortared joints.
It was strangely quiet after the commotion on the street—the only sounds were the gulls,
the faint hum of a heavy drone passing nearby,
and their boots on the cobblestones.

Iffy struggled to keep up with Wales
as he strode confidently toward the center of town.
The sailors and townsfolk she knew ranged from lean to stringy—cold weather
and the sparse Antarctic diet didn't give bodies much chance to put on weight.
Wales' broad shoulders made him look boxy by comparison,
and the cases he was carrying seemed much smaller in his hands than in hers.

"Hang up a jif," Iffy finally said.
Wales stopped as she set her load down on the ground and caught her breath.
Between the Marines' inducted fighting skills,
their drones,
and their armor,
the *Taroona*'s sailors would have had about as much chance
as a snowball in Aunt Naggie's frying pan.
"Sometimes folk fight just so they can tell themselves they did,"
Aunt Naggie had explained after one of Uncle Jack's misadventures.
"Sometimes tryin' is the only kind of winnin' you can hope for."

"*Mon ami! Mon ami!*"
She jumped and squawked as French Henry clattered around the corner,
its dented optics swinging from side to side.
The fixit bot skittered to a halt a few meters away.
"*Ça va bien!*" it announced proudly.
"*Ça va tres bien!*"

"What's it sayin'?" Iffy whispered loudly,
unconsciously backing up a step.
Halley tolerated a handful of free bots for the jobs they could do,
but there were too many stories of machines driven mad by malware left over from the war
for anyone to ever be truly comfortable around something as big as French Henry.

Wales didn't seem bothered in the least.
"*Merci beaucoup, mon vieux.*"
He pulled something that looked like a little gray waffle out of his pocket.
"*Ici. C'est à vous.*"

A hatch on the fixit bot's front panel popped open.
A slender manipulator as long as Iffy's arm unfolded
to pluck the object from in Wales' hand.
It was a heat exchanger,
Iffy realized,
a tiny sibling of one that Mister Mishra had repaired for her
the last time the *Guinevere* was in dock.

A blueprint materialized in her head.
The heat exchanger belonged *there*
in the housing around the fixit bot's quantum core.
Except it hadn't actually been designed to do maintenance.
It was an infiltrator designed to worm its way through sewers and outflow pipes.
Half its parts had been replaced by mis-matched odds and ends taken from other bots
or hacked together out of scrap metal when the tech to make the real thing had been lost,
but its original design was still there beneath the patchwork.

Her vision disappeared
as French Henry's slender manipulator folded back into its housing.
"*Merci beaucoup,*" it said,
rocking back and forth in what might have been the mechanical equivalent of a dog wagging its tail
before rolling away toward the docks
saying, "*Gardez-vous! Gardez-vous!*" once more.

"What was *that* all about?"
Iffy demanded.

Wales shrugged.
"Just a hard-to-find part to help an old friend," he said,
sounding fond and sad at the same time
as the bot disappear around the corner.
"Come on—we should get going."

"Uh huh.
Must be pretty affin' special for it to take a chance on bein' scrapped
for scarin' people like it did back there."
When Wales didn't answer she prodded the case next to her with her boot again.
"So was that you? The 'splosion back there?"

Wales blinked.
"Why on earth would you think that was me?"

Iffy rolled her eyes.
"Cuz they upped your gear an' then the blockhouse blew up
an' then the bot that takes care o' the town's sewers an' all
just happens t' be a friend o' yours
an' now you got your stuff back?
I ain't *stupid*," she finished disgustedly.
Why did grownups always think kids were stupid?

"No you're not," Wales agreed thoughtfully.
He nodded at the case next to her feet.
"Are you okay to carry that a bit further?"

Iffy crossed her arms in unconscious imitation of the *Taroona*'s captain
and raised an eyebrow.

Wales smiled briefly.
"Sorry.
Arra kappa t' carry at down s'far we go long?"

Iffy made a face.
"That was *terrible*," she judged witheringly.
"And sure, but only if I get t'see what's in it."

Wales chuckled.
"Fair enough. Come on."
He glanced up as one last drone zipped past overhead.
Lights sparkled briefly in the rectangle set into his temple,
making Iffy wonder how honestly the drones were reporting the scene
to Halley's central core.

<span id="2024-02-17-d"></span>

They picked up their loads and walked side by side
past the Sandhus' grocery
to the café where Wales had rented an upstairs room.
The owner glanced from Wales to Iffy to the cases
but said nothing more than, "Tea?"

They sat at the café's single stone-topped table
and sipped the strong, minty brew from mis-matched ceramic mugs
the size of Iffy's doubled fists.
Wales sighed contentedly,
then set his mug aside,
lifted the case Iffy had been carrying onto the table,
and opened it.

"Whoa," Iffy breathed.
Some of the tools inside looked as good as new,
though they had to be at least a hundred years old—only
a handful of well-defended factories scattered around the world
still had the cleanrooms and nano-fabricators needed
to create marvels like the fractal iridium mesh that
Wales briefly let her inspect
through a monocle made from a single perfectly-formed diamond.
Other tools were clearly cobbled together
from whatever spare parts Wales had been able to find.
Iffy felt more comfortable with these,
since pretty much everything in Halley was built the same way.

"An' what about those?" she asked eagerly,
pointing at a nested set of asymmetric gears
as Wales carefully repacked everything.

The square man chuckled.
"Let's save them for another time."
The squares in his temples flickered.
"The town says the explosion by the quarantine shed
was apparently a result of faulty maintenance
on an outflow pipe that wasnt't registered in the town plans.
Oh,
and the Marines have resolved the disturbance
involving the crew of an unnamed Australian vessel."

Iffy snorted.
"Faulty maintenance my orphaned arse.
I know that was you."

"I'm sure I have no idea what you mean,"
Wales said drily.

"Uh huh."
Iffy glanced at the clock painted on café wall.
"Oh crivens," she swore,
scrambling to her feet.
She'd been gone nearly half an hour—Aunt Naggie would be worried sick
and Uncle Jack would be furious.

"Hold on," Wales said, patting the air.
"Just a minute, I promise.
Tell me more about this ship of yours…"

Wales locked his toolboxes in his room before they left
and put a small toy bear with bright blue eyes on the shelf above them.
"To keep an eye on things,"
he said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
Iffy nodded—smart toys were an everyday thing,
even for someone who had grown up as poor as she had.
She didn't know what the orange-and-red globe of Mars next to the bear was for,
but she suspected it would do more than just watch if someone broke in.

A pair of bulky gray drones hovered over the harbor
as Iffy and Wales walked down to the pier.
"Keeping an eye on the *Taroona*," Wales guessed,
shielding his eyes with his hand to study them.
"Those forks on the front are ultrasonics.
One zap from them and you'll have a headache for a week.
The nozzles behind them probably spray strangle foam."

"Why are they just watchin'?" Iffy asked.
"Why don't th' Marines just haul everyone in for th' governors to sort out?"

Wales sighed.
"Politics.
Even if they *did* blow up the quarantine building,
the *Taroona* and the rest of the Australian fleet
are the only thing stopping the Brazilians from walking in here.
Odds are the captain and her crew will be back on the dock by morning,"
he continued,
speaking to himself as much as to the frowning tween beside him.
"Which is another reason I need to talk to your uncle."

"Y'oughta know he don't keep his word 'less it suits him,"
Iffy warned.
"Or 'less he figures you got some serious haul back o' you."

Wales nodded.
"Thank you—I'll keep that in mind."

Ten minutes later Uncle Jack shouted,
"No affin' way!
We're a jelly dredger,
not an affin' ferryboat!
You wanna hitch up along Rothera,
get yourself three piers over an' buy a ticket."

Wales' polite expression didn't waver.
"I understand it's not your usual line of work,"
he said smoothly
when the *Guinevere*'s bleary-eyed captain paused for breath.
"And if no is your final answer,
I'll respect that and take my business elsewhere.
But!"
He held up a hand to forestall another outburst.
"What if I could do more than just pay for my passage?"

Uncle Jack snorted.
He had been dozing when Iffy and Wales reached the *Guinevere*,
and from his squint and the smell on his breath
Iffy guessed that she'd find at least one empty bottle in the recycling
if she bothered to go and look.
"Lemme guess—you can sing.
Or no—you can do magic tricks an' turn jellyfish into gold."

"Almost," Wales nodded.
"Except it isn't magic, and gold will be all yours."
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"This is a satellite uplink.
A *fully functional* satellite uplink,"
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth.
"Which means I can spot patches of sea boil with half an hour to spare.
Maybe a full hour, if a satellite is in the right positions.
And *that* means—"

Uncle Jack said a word that sent Aunt Naggie's hands flying to her mouth.
"Ain't no such thing,"
the *Guinevere*'s captain sneered.
"Not since the war—everyone knows that.
The sats are all 'crypted an' th' keys are long gone."

"They are indeed encrypted," Wales nodded.
"But as for the keys…"
He closed his eyes.
"Your beacon is GUIN40782, is that right?"
He nodded to himself without waiting for an answer.
"Your last trip, you were at sea nine days.
You spent most of it over the Berkner Rise."

"So what?" Uncle Jack contemptuously.
"Everyone 'round here dredges th' Berk."

"Some with more luck than others," Wales observed coolly.
"Take the *Whitstable*, for example.
The jellyfish they brought back came up in a boil
just twenty kay northeast of you.
If you'd known it was happening,
they could have been yours."

Uncle Jack scowled.
The *Whitstable* was tied up two piers over,
her captain overseeing a refit
paid for by the full hold she had brought back
the day after the *Guinevere* had returned.
Her crew had been celebrating their good fortune in Halley's shops and bars ever since.

Uncle Jack scratched his cheek through his uncombed beard.
Iffy could practically hear him resenting the other ship's good luck.
"You're shaddin' me," he growled.
"There's no way you could know somethin' like that 'fore it happened."

Wales didn't answer.
Instead,
he closed his eyes again and pointed toward the *Guinevere*'s stern.
"There's a pair of Aussie freighters a hundred and forty kay that way,
core pilots and human crews,
carrying…"
He paused.
"Profile looks like grain,
but they have something heavier for ballast.
Smuggling in machinery to swap for coal, most likely."
He pivoted twenty degrees like a weathervane.
"The *Peacock*, the *Reculver*, and the *Watney Breach* are dredging together.
They're not going to find much—the sea bottom there
might as well be concrete."
He pivoted again.
"And there's a Brazilian catamaran out that way,
three hundred kay and bearing northwest."
He smiled slightly.
"She looks like an old lady dressed up for church."

He turned back toward them and opened his eyes.
"I can get all of it,"
he said in a voice that left no room for doubt or disagreement.
"Every image, every signal.
And I need to get to Rothera.
The only question is, will that be your good fortune or someone else's?"

Uncle Jack hefted his gaff hook.
"Jack," Aunt Naggie began.

"Quiet," he snapped, greed and mistrust warring on his face.
"We keep whatever we haul," he finally said.
"An' th' moment we tie up,
you're off an' I never heard o' you."

"Fair enough," Wales agreed.
He stuck out his hand.

Iffy held her breath.
Uncle Jack scowled a moment longer,
then grabbed it and gave it a single perfunctory shake.
"I'm guessin' you'll want t' be off right away," he said sourly.

Wales nodded.
"Just as soon as I collect my—"
He froze.

"What?" Uncle Jack demanded.
Wales raised a hand for silence, his eyes half-closed.

"Oh no," Uncle Jack blustered,
drawing himself up to his full height.
"You don't shush me on my ship, you—"

"Someone is breaking into my room."
Wales said curtly.
"Warm up the engines and get ready to cast off.
I'll be back in ten minutes."

"We'll cast off when *I* say!"
Uncle Jack said angrily.

Iffy's heart sank.
Telling Uncle Jack what to do *always* made him do the opposite.

But her uncle's anger had no more effect on Wales
than a windstorm would on a mountain.
"Here."
He pulled a money out of his jacket and thrust it at Uncle Jack.
"A down payment."

Uncle Jack turned the black plastic rectangle over in his hands suspiciously.
"What's it worth?"

"Six thousand rand," Wales said.

"Six *thousand*?"
Uncle Jack pressed his thumb on the corner of the money.
His eyes widened at the blinking figures it displayed,
then narrowed again as he looked Wales up and down.
"You must wanna get outta here pretty badly,"
he mused.

"It's no use to me if I can't spend it,"
Wales said crisply.
"Do we still have a deal?"

Uncle Jack pocketed the card and grunted something unintelligible.
"Thank you," Wales said. "I'll be quick."
He turned to go, then stopped himself and tapped the tech in his temple.
"Just so you know, this is still switched on.
So if you try to call the Marines, I'll know."

Uncle Jack spat over the taffrail.
"Ain't nobody here calls th' Blues," he growled.

"And none of your business associates either, please,"
Wales added coolly.
"Or I'll send the Marines to call on *them*
and make it look like you did."

Wales strode down the gangplank before Uncle Jack could reply,
lengthening his stride into a jog
that carried him along the pier and into town.
"That one's trouble," Uncle Jack said flatly.
He leaned his elbows on the taffrail,
cleared his throat,
and spat again into the water below.
There was more gray in his beard than there used to be,
Iffy thought,
and the three-day fuzz on his shaved scalp
had crept further and further away from his forehead.

Uncle Jack noticed her looking at him.
"Well, get movin'!" he barked,
straightening up.
"You too, woman," he added to Aunt Naggie.
"I want us away from whatever's chasin' him soon as he's back."
He strode away,
muttering to himself.

Aunt Naggie and Iffy whooshed out their breath at the same time.
"You gonna tell me what's abunder?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy shrugged helplessly.
"I dunno, auntie, true I don't.
There was a fight up along by quarantine,
an' French Henry got into it, and…"
*And all of a sudden I know how to tag someone twice my size,*
she almost added but didn't.
Bots weren't the only ones infected with malware during the war.
Talking about her visions with anyone—even Aunt Naggie—would mean
opening a door she would rather stay closed.

But something in her expression caught Aunt Naggie's eye.
She put her hand on Iffy's forehead.
"Just be still," she shushed,
stern and worried at the same time.
After a moment she took her hand away,
but her expression didn't change.
"There's no fever.
How about you start gettin' us ready an' I'll make somethin' quick to eat?"

"Tea'd be nice," Iffy said gratefully.

It normally took a full day to get the *Guinevere* ready to sail,
but the money in Uncle Jack's pocket seemed to make him believe it could be done in a blink.
He roared at Iffy and Aunt Naggie to move their sorry sterns,
and no,
don't worry about tyin' that down,
they could take care of it once they were at sea,
just put it somewhere for now and get the affin' engine goin!

It took Iffy five minutes of careful work to put the reciprocating rod back in place.
Five more minutes and the engine was chugging away,
biofuel gurgling through kinks in the feed pipe
that she had never been able to get rid of.
She would normally have checked the winch motor
to make sure they could haul in whatever they caught,
but instead she laced some straps around the fine mesh dredging nets
to stop them shifting or tangling in high seas.
Wait—the fuel hose!
It was still connected to the pump on the pier.
If they had set sail without undoing it,
it would have snapped like an overstretched rubber band.
She had seen that happen once.
It had sounded like a gunshot,
and the end had torn open an unlucky sailor's cheek.

She scrambled up the ladder that connected the engine room to the deck.
"Ready below," she called.

Aunt Naggie coiled the last stayline and shoved it into a canvas bag,
then shoved the bag into a bench locker and dogged the seat-lid shut.
"That's all for me too."
She handed Iffy half a sandwich—scrambled egg with more of Mrs. Sandhu's spice mix—and
waited for her foster daughter to wolf it down
before thumping the cabin wall with her fist.
"Good when you are," she shouted,
confident as she always was when something needed to be done.

The cabin door flew open.
Uncle Jack stepped out onto deck,
glaring at his wife and foster daughter on principle.
"That's what I said," he told the empty air impatiently.
"Six thousand rand.
I'll have it in a week.
What?
Never you mind how, but that'll more'n put us square.
Right.
Aright.
What?
No, you affin' well better *not* tell her,
or she'll skin both of us!
Right.
Aright.
*Vi da*."
He blinked twice to end the call and bared his teeth.

"Who was that?" Aunt Naggie asked cautiously.

Uncle Jack's self-satisfied smile vanished.
"Ne'er you mind," he said brusquely.
"Everythin' stowed?"

"Everythin' that's gonna be," Aunt Naggie said.
"But Jack—"

"I said, ne'er mind!"
He slapped the taffrail with his hand.
"Now where's our high-top troublemaker?"

Five minutes crawled by,
each one tenser than the last,
until Wales appeared at the end of the pier
with one toolbox in each hand.
The third hung over his shoulder on a strap,
and he had a small travelling pack on his back.

Iffy scurried down the gangplank and ran to him.
"Thank you,"
Wales said gratefully
as she took one of the boxes from his hand.

"No worries," Iffy replied.
Then she gasped.
"You're bleeding!"

"Still?"
Wales pulled a rag out of his pocket,
dabbed at his nose,
and studied the red blotch a moment.
"So I am."
He put the rag back in his pocket and limped toward the *Guinevere*.

"What happened?"
Iffy puffed as she fell into step beside him.
"Was someone really tryin' t' break into your room?
Were they along from the *Taroona*?
Did you get punched up?
An' what's wrong with your leg?"

"Oh, everything was mostly sorted out by the time I got there,"
Wales said vaguely.
"And my leg's bothered me for years.
I keep meaning to get it looked at,
but I never seem to have time.
There's just never enough time," he repeated.

Uncle Jack didn't wait for Wales to stow his belongings
before hauling in the gangplank and casting off.
The engine rumbled and coughed for a moment
as they pulled away from the pier,
then settled into the steady thumping that was as familiar to Iffy as her own breathing.

They were halfway across the harbor
when a klaxon blared *brrrap! brrrap!*
Iffy ran to the stern in time to see
a flock of drones converge on a pier halfway around the harbor
from the *Guinevere*'s berth.

A single ship lay alongside the pier,
long and low and gray and dangerous—the *Taroona*.
Iffy shaded her eyes with her hand.
The ship looked like she was casting off,
but no,
a pair of Marine cutters had boxed her in
and a platoon of figures in blue were trotting down the pier.
She glanced at Wales,
wondering if this was somehow his doing,
but the American's eyes were on the horizon ahead of them.

They rounded the broken-backed carrier that was Halley's seawall a few minutes later.
The swell beneath them instantly grew stronger.
Uncle Jack took the first watch,
grumbling that if they were hauled in by the Marines
everyone should just let him do the talking.
Aunt Naggie said she would take the second watch,
then shooed Iffy off to sleep.
"You can talk to Mister Johnson in the morning,"
she said firmly.
"Let him have his rest now."
Then she smiled the way she only did
when she and her foster daughter were alone together.
"You'll need some too
if you're gonna go chattin' up that special friend o' yours."

"Honesty ain't special!" Iffy protested automatically.
Still smiling,
her foster mother pulled her into a hug and kissed the shaven top of her head,
then gently pulled the door of the storage locker closed behind her.

Iffy took her nature book out from under her mattress
and lay on her stomach to page through it.
The orca, the tiger, the gorilla…
She ran her fingers over the pictures,
sounding out the handwritten comments beside them.
*Mom took us to see the baby giraffes today,* said one.
*There are three of them.
They are all clones and they live in a big dome because of the virus.
Mom says they have been tweaked to be immune to it.*
And then,
in an older version of the same hand,
*Turns out they weren't.
Mom says there isn't money to try again.*
And then there was a sad cartoon face,
one of several scattered through the book.

Iffy browsed the other animals,
wondering what it would have been like to live in a world
that had so many different kinds of creatures.
She stubbornly tried to keep her eyelids from closing
until she couldn't remember why they shouldn't.
When she finally dozed, she dreamed.

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," Second said, forcing a smile.*

*When the ship's horn blared it wasn't a horn at all
but the sound of a drill press.
She was in Mister Mishra's,
fumbling clumsily to reassemble a mound of chips and gears and actuators
that she had never seen before.
Her heart raced as she tried to piece them together.
This rod into that socket—no,
that couldn't be right,
it turned the wrong way and didn't leave enough space for the lens,
because the lens had to go there,
it had to,
she didn't know how she knew but she did and time was running out.*

*And then suddenly she could see the whole design
from the overall schematic
down to the bevelled teeth of the microscopic gears
that would catch and grind on specks of dust too small to see or feel
if they weren't assembled just so in airtight diamond cases.
There and there,
that's where the hair-fine optical fibers had to go,
and there,
right in the machine's heart,
was the space where a miniaturized core could—*

*The whole room heeled hard, throwing her to the floor.
"She's gonna blow!" Mister Mishra shouted,
and then all Iffy could hear was a rushing sound
as the ship fell away beneath her into a pit of churning foam.*

She woke up drenched in sweat.
She kicked her way out of her sleeping back,
rolled over,
and buried her face in her mattress.
When her tears finally ran dry she wiped her nose angrily on her sleeve,
rolled over on her back,
and fumbled on the floor beside her for her water bottle
before remembering that she hadn't refilled it.
"Idiot," she muttered,
thumping her fist against her mattress.

It took her a long time to fall asleep again.

## Chapter 3

It was four days to Rothera across the Weddell Sea.
Once upon a time their route would have taken them over a solid sheet of ice.
During the Melt they would have had to thread their way between cakes and bergs,
but those days were long gone too.
There was nothing between them and their destination except
floating plastic,
the inevitable gulls,
and the waves.

In no time at all Halley had fallen below the horizon.
After motoring for an hour under thin, high clouds,
Uncle Jack ordered the *Guinevere* to raise her sails.
The ship's tiny core obediently ran mis-matched gossamer sheets up her twin Y-masts.
Waves a meter high made the *Guinevere* rock from side to side in a rhythm
that Iffy knew as well as she knew her own heartbeat.

"Best stay outta his way," Aunt Naggie advised
when her foster daughter clambered down into the galley to get tea.
"He ain't used t' havin' folk on board, but I 'spect he'll settle in."
It sounded more like a prayer than a prediction,
but Iffy nodded and climbed back on deck
with a chipped ceramic mug in her hand.

"'Bout affin' time," her uncle said sharply
when she knocked on the door of the pilot house
and handed him the mug.
He slurped a mouthful and set it in the ring next to the ship's wheel.

Iffy glanced at the control panel.
Tiny cameras dotted about the ship showed the engine,
the hold,
the sails,
and practically everywhere else on the ship
except the insides of the cabins and the tiny toilet near the stern.
Small graphs scattered among the images told her at a glance
how much fuel they had,
how much tension was in the forestays and mainstays,
and what the wind and the currents around them were doing.

The most important display was the sonar.
Every captain kept a close eye on that if they wanted to make it home.
At the first sign of gas bubbling up from the ocean floor,
they would fire up the engine and run.

Uncle Jack jerked a thumb at a panel highlighted in orange.
"You get that backstay cable mended soonish if you want lunch,"
he growled.

"Yessir," Iffy said obediently.
He'd been drinking again, she realized.
She could smell it on his breath,
and from the way he clutched the wheel to hold himself steady
she guessed he'd been at it for a while.

"An' see if that baggage o' yours wants t' make himself useful as well,"
Uncle Jack added as she turned to go.
"Or better yet, just tell 'im I told him to!"

Wales had reorganized the ship's other storage locker while Iffy was asleep
to make room for his pack and toolboxes.
He was seated on a thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern,
seemingly lost in thought as Iffy approached him,
but said, "Of course," in reply to Iffy's tentative request for help.
Standing,
he straightened his jacket and smiled.
"Being useful would do me good right now."

"You thinkin' bout them off th' *Taroona*?
Not that it's any o' my look-in,"
she added hastily.

Wales shook his head.
"No,
I was thinking about the *Landrieu*.
The big ship back at Halley,"
he continued as Iffy gave him a blank look.
"The one the town uses as a breakwater.
She was a marvel in her time.
Fractal carbon ribs,
a foamed poly-composite hull,
and a core smart enough to qualify for citizenship.
She was the first of her kind to solo the Pacific,
but then the war came, and…"
He sighed.
"It must have broken her heart to up like this."

"I guess," Iffy said to fill the silence that followed.
"Can't imagine how I'd feel if somethin' like that happened to th' *Ginny*.
Or to me,"
she added after a moment's thought.

Wales shook his head to clear it.
"Let's hope you never have to find out," he said,
suddenly brisk.
"Now, where's this cable we're supposed to splice?"

Iffy had hoped that Wales would bring out his toolboxes—she
was itching to examine their contents in detail—but instead,
he studied the hacked-off ends of the backstay cable
with a hand-held smart lens
that highlighted the worse of the damage in garish reds and yellows.
Iffy wanted to tell him that the damage wasn't her fault,
but she bit back her words.
There was no way she could say that without pointing the finger at Uncle Jack,
and as much as she wanted him to think well of her as a mechanic,
no self-respecting sailor would ever cast shade on her captain
in front of a passenger.

"All right," Wales said,
slipping the magnifier back into one of his coat's many pockets.
"What's the plan—splice, clamp, strap, or weld?"

"I was thinkin' I could splice it?" Iffy ventured hesitantly.
When Wales nodded
she fished a roll of twisted eight-gauge cable from her bag of odds and ends
and dug around to find a wire cutter and a pair of needle-nosed pliers.

The next half hour flew by as Iffy lost herself in the task at hand.
She had expected Wales to take charge,
but instead he asked one question after another,
drawing ideas out of her that she hadn't know were there.
It was like the schematics that sometimes popped into her head
but without the chill in her gut of not knowing where they came from.

Once the first dozen lengths of splice were woven into the cable
Wales sat cross-legged on the deck and held the ends together
so that Iffy could finish connecting them.
She worked as quickly as she could,
waiting for him to say it was time for a break,
but he didn't.
*Uncle Jack wouldn't have been able to hold the cable like that,* she thought.
Even Mister Mishra would have struggled after a minute or two,
but Wales seemed unbothered.
She glanced at the silver rectangles in his temples
and wondered what other tech he might have that wasn't so visible.

Over, through, under, through…
"There." She sat back on her haunches.
"Wanna see if it holds together?"

Wales stood,
trapped one end of the cable under his boot,
and pulled hard.
The splice stretched slightly,
and for a moment Iffy was afraid it would give way,
but it held.
"Looks good to me.
Well done."

Iffy shrugged, embarrassed by the praise.
"Only one way t' find out for sure."
She hit the switch on the winch beside her.
The cable zinged as it was wound taut.
Iffy picked up a wrench and whacked the splice a couple of times as hard as she could.

Wales blinked. "Are you always this direct when you're working?"

Iffy grinned. "Pretty much."
