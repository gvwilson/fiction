"I don't work with musicians.
Or actors, or celebrity baristas, or virtuals.
You know that."

Bench grinned.
"Maybe this'll change your mind."
She pulled a holo out of the sleeve of her suit jacket,
slid it across the black quartzite table,
and sat back,
already looking smug.

I put down my coffee and picked it up.
"Turner,"
I said.
"*Rain, Steam, and Speed*, mid 1840s.
It's beautiful."
I sighed as Bench's grin widened to show off her fashionable steel teeth.
"Let me guess---your noodle has it."

"He's not 'mine', and he's not a noodle.
He's just...new."
She waved a hand to forgive everyone in the world
who hadn't grown up with enough to be comfortable
but not so much that they needed people like me.
"It showed up at an estate sale a few months ago,
and yes,
I made sure he hung it properly.
Just give him ten minutes,"
she wheedled.
"I'll tell him you need to,
I don't know,
center yourself or some bullshit first.
You can have as much time with it as you want before you talk to him."

I gave her a tired look.
"Excellent," she purred,
reaching for her pad.
"He's not really a morning person, so how about---"

A hundred devices beeped, bleebled, or chimed in unison around us,
momentarily derailing conversation.
"Called it,"
Bench said,
turning her pad to show me the news.
Vitaly Mendonca:
Brazilian,
fifty-four,
inherited a construction company after his father died (natural causes),
then made a fortune in remediation work.
He'd been on and off the leaderboard for years,
always safely out of the top ten until a couple of hours ago.
A combination of fluctuating exchange rates
and an automatic contract renewal someone had forgotten to account for
had suddenly catapulted him into the number one spot.
His handler---some German whiz kid
whose name I sort of recognized---had been trying frantically to unload stuff since then,
but apparently it hadn't been enough.
A few minutes ago Senhor Mendonca had gone from
briefly being the richest person in the world
to permanently being dead.

I swallowed the dregs of my coffee and stood up,
tucking the holo into my sleeve.
"Put him in my calendar," I said as the buzz in the coffee shop resumed.
"Give me half an hour with the painting.
And Bench---he really better not be a noodle."

---

He was a noodle.
I got an hour with the Turner,
though,
which almost made the trip worthwhile.
It dropped out of sight in the early '30s
when English museums started putting their collections out on "permanent loan"
to make ends meet.
It showed up at a sale in Italy a few years later,
pre-leaderboard,
then disappeared again until Guo Leji stopped being
Vice Premier of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
(or so my pad told me)
and started being dead.

I scrolled down,
filling time while my minidrone camera completed its scan.
Guo's story was typical:
graft, bribes, fingers in too many pies, yadda bloody boo,
so tangled that even AI accountants couldn't keep track of it.
Or maybe he didn't trust them and tried to juggle it all in his head.

The camera chimed softly to tell me it was done.
I held out my hand and waited for it to settle on my palm.
Twenty terabytes wasn't an archival-quality scan,
but it would be good enough to train the AI painting tutor
that was trying to teach me how to perform miracles like this.

I stepped back and gave it one last long look.
I'd put off the inevitable for as long as I plausibly could.
I put the camera in its case,
put the case in my satchel,
and went to find Bench and her client.

Chibundu "Zeebop" Unigwe,
twenty-seven.
Born in Lagos,
grew up in Accra,
started coding music in his teens,
had his first viral show at nineteen
and a string of others since then.
He was rich enough that he could buy half a floor in the independent half of Manhattan,
decorate it in blond pine,
and hang a few masterworks like the Turner,
but he wasn't even in the top ten kay on the board.
There was no family wealth to complicate things,
and nothing to signal someone higher up might have set him up as a dumpster.

He bumped elbows with me and offered me a seat
while Bench did something competent with a chrome Egyptian coffee set.
We made small talk for a few moments,
and then he asked the question everyone asks:
who did I think was responsible?
God?
Aliens?
Some kind of AI, or the Israeli government-in-exile
(which I assumed was what he meant by "the Mossad")?

I shrugged.
"Doesn't matter," I said,
and it didn't,
at least not to me.
"What _matters_ is transparency.
Anything you hold back or keep off the books is a risk."

He nodded.
"Of course.
I do have some thoughts about that.
Have you see this?"
He brushed the air backhand,
sending a clip to my pad.

I heard Bench exhale as it opened on hers as well.
She'd never been much of a poker player.
"Yes, I've seen it,"
I said flatly.
I hadn't,
but I'd seen bullshit like it a hundred times before.
"It's not reliable."

"But look at their research,"
Unigwe insisted,
clearly not used to being told he was wrong.
"In cases where there was no contract---"

"Contracts don't matter,"
I said.
"If whoever you give it to thinks they're supposed to give it back,
it counts as your money.
Even if they're planning to steal it.
Even if they _do_ steal it.
With respect,
Mister Unigwe,
we've known that for years,
and there's no way around it."

Unigwe's jaw set.
"That's a defeatist attitude," he snapped.
From the way he said it
I could tell it was some fashionable memer's current explanation
for all the world's ills.

"I prefer to think of it as cautious," I said.
distracted by the smell of coffee.
It had to be fabbed---anyone who could afford real beans
wouldn't be wasting their time on wishful thinking
about other people holding their money for them---but
it still smelled delicious.

I swiped Bench a surreptitious thumbs down.
She swiped me back a shrug.
She could bill the noodle for her time,
and I had my scan so I'd forgive her for wasting mine.
All that was left was some more small talk
and insincere promises to think about it and follow up at some unspecified future time.
